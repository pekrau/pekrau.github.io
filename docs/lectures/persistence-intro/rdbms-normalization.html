<P>
The tables in an RDBMS database should ideally be designed to be
normalized.
<UL>
<LI> Improves update efficiency,.
<LI> Removes many causes of anomalous data dependencies
<LI> Allows better checks for consistency.
<LI> Is (usually) better for query handling.
<LI> But: computational penalties in some SQL operations.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Essentially, normalization means that no data item should occur more
than once in the tables; duplication should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Foreign keys are vital for creating normalized database designs. Data
that is present in several copies in one table should be split out
into a separate table, and a foreign key should be created from the
original table to the new one.
</P>
<P>
For example, <A HREF="rdbms-table-examples.html">the tables in the
example</A> contain a column 'species' that contains identical
strings. This should be normalized: 
<UL>
<LI> The strings should be moved into a separate table 'Species' having
columns 'number' and 'name'.
<LI> The tables 'Gene' and 'Protein' should use foreign keys to refer
to the relevant row in 'Species'
</UL>
</P>

<P>
There are several different levels of normalization (normal
forms). See for example
<A HREF="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/academics/courses/is202/f97/Lecture8/">this
Berkeley lecture on database desing</A> for more information.
