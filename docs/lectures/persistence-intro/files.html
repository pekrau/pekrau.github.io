<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Files</H1>

<P>
Files are the simplest, most primitive persistence mechanism.
</P>

<UL>
<LI> Simply a sequential chunk of bytes stored on some permanent
 medium.
<LI> The content of a file has no  inherent structure: <STRONG>Flat
 files</STRONG>
<LI> The structure is implied by the actions of whichever program is
used to access the data.
</P>
</UL>

<P>
When using simple files for persistence, the executing program must
deal with all details of how to access the data in the file:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> What data is where? (e.g. sequential vs. random-access)
<LI> What form does it have; encoding? (e.g. text/ASCII vs. binary)
<LI> What to do when data is missing?
<LI> What to do when the data is invalid?
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>Parsing</STRONG> is the process of interpreting the contents
of a file in terms of data structures in a program. Software tools for
parsing (C, C++): <STRONG>lex</STRONG> and <STRONG>yacc</STRONG>.
</P>

<H3>Good points</H3>
<UL>
<LI> The simplest to program.
<LI> The basic operations (create, open, read, write) are available in
all programming languages.
<LI> Best when the data is simple (low complexity).
<LI> Best when only sequential searches are required.
</UL>

<H3>Bad points</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Difficulties increase seriously with data complexity.
<LI> Difficult to solve complicated search problems efficiently.
<LI> Problems with concurrent use by independent processes.
<LI> Updating (modifying parts) is usually very tricky.
</UL>
