<UL>
<LI> The RDBMS checks data (insert, update, delete) to avoid
inconsistencies. 
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Several levels of data integrity:
  <UL>
  <LI> NOT NULL: complain if no value given.
  <LI> PRIMARY KEY: values must be unique in the table.
  <LI> FOREIGN KEY: the row referred to must exist.
  <LI> Transactions: a set of operations must all succeed, or all
  changes in the set are rolled back (COMMIT, ROLLBACK). This is
  extremely useful for complex databases.
  <LI> Data locking, to prevent others from accessing data being changed.
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI> All SQL-compliant systems should make these checks, but not all
have implemented this.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Used in the right way, can stop mistaken operations from damaging
the data.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> If wrong design, then data integrity constraints may complicate
updates (circular foreign keys).
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> These checks require computation: no free lunch!
</UL>
