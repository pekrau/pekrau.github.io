<P>
The basic idea for object-oriented database management systems is that
an object-oriented program should be able to more-or-less magically
save and retrieve any object in a simple way.
</P>
<P>
Superficially, it should be simple to connect objects in a program to
a RDBMS: just make one table for each class of objects.
</P>
<P>
But in practice, there are serious problems with this: If the
object-oriented programming (OOP) uses inheritance, then it is not 
obvious how to deal with that in the tables.
</P>
<P>
There are many different object-oriented database systems. This is
actually a problem: very few (if any) standards exist, so no system is
like another.
</P>
Here are some examples of free (GPL license, or similar)
object-oriented database systems:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/">AceDB</A>, created for the
<I>C. elegans</I> genome project, and used for many others.
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/">ZODB</A>, a system for
Python.
</UL>
