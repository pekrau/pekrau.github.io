<P>
Living cells can be viewed as <STRONG>signal processors</STRONG>. That
is not all they are, but it is a useful perspective in the current
context. The cells <STRONG>receive signals from the
environment</STRONG> in the form of specific molecules (e.g. hormones,
transmitter substances), nutrient levels (e.g. glucose, lipids) or
stresses (e.g. osmotic pressure, poisons, heat, cold). The cells also 
<STRONG>produce signals internally</STRONG>, e.g. in the cell cycle,
where such events as DNA damage or failures in chromosome duplication
generate signals that stop cell division from occuring, and may also
start repair processes or to begin the cell death program (apoptosis).

<P>
The various signals and the machinery that processes them form a
regulatory network. The purpose of the network is to control the life
processes so that the organism can grow, survive and multiply in a
constantly changing and challenging
environment. <STRONG>Regulation</STRONG> is the key term here. The
appropriate systems must be started up, or shut down, as the
environment changes. If suddenly glucose becomes available, then the
bacterium must produce glucose transport proteins and enzymes for the
glucose metabolism. If the glucose level is then reduced, the
bacterium needs to reduce the production of these proteins since
otherwise unnecessary energy is wasted on synthesizing the
proteins. An important concept in this connection is
<STRONG>homeostasis</STRONG>, the tendency of living systems to
maintain a steady level of important metabolites or other components
in the face of varying external circumstances. The most obvious
example is the constant body temperature in many animals.

An essential mechanism in regulation is <STRONG>feedback</STRONG>. The
result of a process feeds back signals to control the process
itself. This makes the process self-monitoring to some degree. One
distinguishes between negative and positive feedback.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Negative feedback</STRONG> is a system where the product or
resulting signal down-regulates the process. This may be useful to
keep the level of a substance at a steady state. This is very common
in the metabolism, since the organism only wants to produce as much as
is needed of some particular compound, and no more. For example, many
synthesis pathways for compounds such as amino acids are regulated by
negative feedback, where the final product of the pathway influences
some early step in the pathway negatively by inhibiting an enzyme. In
the figure, compound D binds to enzyme E2, thereby inhibiting it, and
reducing the further production of itself.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Positive feedback</STRONG> is a signalling loop where the
product reinforces the process. This is found in systems which have to
maintain one chosen state among several alternatives, e.g. the
specific state of a differentiated cell, or to commit a cell towards a
chosen development path. The starting point is an undecided state,
which by some process (influence from the outside, or purely
stochastic events) starts to tilt over in one particular
direction. This small, initial bias is then reinforced by the
regulatory system, so that a final, fixed, stable state is reached.
</P>

<P>
A special, very important class of regulatory networks generate
<STRONG>cyclic processes</STRONG>. These are processes that never
reach a steady state, but move between stages or states in an ordered
fashion. There are many important examples of cyclic processes: The
<STRONG>cell cycle</STRONG> is the prime example, but one could also
mention the <STRONG>circadian clock</STRONG> (the changes following
the time of day) in many plants and animals. These systems require
complex networks having a dynamically cyclic behaviour that must both
be robust and sensitive: Robust in the sense that it must continue to
work even when the environment changes, and sensitive so that the
process can adjust when the appropriate corrective signals are
received from the environment.
