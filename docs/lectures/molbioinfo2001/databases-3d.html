<H3>PDB
<A HREF="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">www.rcsb.org/pdb/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The PDB is the <STRONG>main primary database for 3D
structures</STRONG> of biological macromolecules determined by X-ray
crystallography and NMR. Structural biologists usually deposit their
structures in the PDB on publication, and some scientific journals
require this before accepting a paper. It also accepts the
experimental data used to determine the structures (X-ray structure
factors and NMR restraints) and homology models. As of 16 Jan 2001 the
PDB contained 14,109 entries, the majority of which (11,611) are X-ray 
structures.
</P>

<P>
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established in the 1970s at the
Brookhaven Lab on Long Island, New York State, US. In 1999, the
management was moved to the Research Collaboratory for Structural
Bionformatics (RCSB, a joint organisation between Rutgers University,
San Diego Supercomputer Center and NIST).
</P>

<P>
The PDB entries contain the <STRONG>atomic coordinates</STRONG>, and
some structural parameters connected with the atoms (B-factors,
occupancies), or computed from the structures (secondary
structure). The PDB entries contain some annotation, but it is not
as comprehensive as in SWISS-PROT. Fortunately, there are cross-links
between the databases in both file formats. Here is an example of an
entry is the the Ras-binding domain of the human Raf-1 oncogene in <A
HREF="1rrb.pdb.txt">the traditional PDB format</A> and in
<A HREF="1rrb.mmcif">the mmCIF format</A>. 
</P>


<P>
There are <STRONG>no legal restrictions</STRONG> on the use of the
data in the PDB.
</P>

<H3>SCOP
<A HREF="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/">scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database was started
by Alexey Murzin in 1994 (Lab of Molecular Biology, MRC, Cambridge,
UK). Its purpose is to <STRONG>classify protein 3D structures in a
hierarchical scheme of structural classes</STRONG>. It is maintained
by experts (manually), and all protein structures in the PDB are 
classified, and it is updated as new structures are deposited in the
PDB. 
</P>

<P>
This is <STRONG>a typical secondary database</STRONG>; it is based on
data in a primary database (in this case the PDB), but adds
information through analysis and/or organisation, in this case the
classification of protein 3D structures into a hierarchical scheme of
folds, superfamilies and families.
</P>

<H3>CATH
<A HREF="http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/">www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/cath/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The CATH database (Class, Architecure, Topology, Homologous
superfamily) is a hierarchical classification of protein domain
structures, which <STRONG>clusters proteins at four major structural
levels</STRONG>. Although the aim is very similar to SCOP, the scheme
is different, and the philosophy and practical details of producing
the classification differ considerably. For instance, a larger
part of the classification of a new protein  3D structure is made
automatically by software. It was started by Christine Orengo in Janet
Thornton's lab (University College London) in 1996.
