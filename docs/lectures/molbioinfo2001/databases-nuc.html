<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Primary nucleotide sequence databases</H2>

<P>
The databases EMBL, GenBank, and DDBJ are the <STRONG>three primary
nucleotide sequence databases</STRONG>: They include sequences
submitted directly by scientists and genome sequencing group, and
sequences taken from literature and patents. There is comparatively
little error checking and there is a fair amount of redundancy. 
</P>

<P>
The entries in the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ databases are
<STRONG>synchronized</STRONG> on a daily basis, and the accession
numbers are managed in a consistent manner between these three
centers.
</P>

<P>
The nucleotide databases have reached such large sizes that they are
available in <STRONG>subdivisions</STRONG> that allow searches or
downloads that are more limited, and hence less
time-consuming. For example, GenBank has currently 17 divisions.
</P>

<P>
There are <STRONG>no legal restrictions</STRONG> on the use of the
data in these databases. However, there are patented sequences in the
databases. 
</P>

<H3>EMBL
<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/">www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) nucleotide sequence
database is maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
in Hinxton, Cambridge, UK. As of 16 Jan 2001, it contained 10,378,022
records with a total of 11,302,156,937 bases; see
<A HREF="http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/DBStats/">the EMBL DB
statistics page</A>.
</P>

<P>
It can be accessed and searched through
<A HREF="http://srs6.ebi.ac.uk">the SRS system at EBI</A>, or one can
download the entire database as flat files. An example of what an
entry looks like is given for the 
<A HREF="hsrafr.embl">human raf oncogene protein, ID: HSRAFR</A>.
</P>

<H3>GenBank
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The GenBank nucleotide database is maintained by the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which is part of the National
Institute of Health (NIH), a federal agency of the US government.
</P>

<P>
It can be accessed and searched through
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">the Entrez system at
NCBI</A>, or one can download the entire database as flat files. An
example of what an entry looks like is given for the 
<A HREF="gi35841.genbank">human raf oncogene protein, Locus: HSRAFR</A>.
</P>

<H3>DDBJ
<A HREF="http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/">www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp</A>
</H3>

<P>
The DNA Data Bank of Japan began as a collaboration with EMBL and
GenBank. It is run by the National Institute of Genetics. One can
search for entries by accession number, FASTA/BLAST, keywords and
regular expressions.
</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Other nucleotide sequence databases</H2>

<P>
The following databases contain subsets of the EMBL/GenBank databases.
Some also contain more information or links than the primary ones, or
have a different organization of the data to better suit some specific
purpose. However, the nucleotide sequences themselves should always be
available in the EMBL/GenBank databases. In this sense, the databases
below are secondary databases.
</P>

<H3>UniGene
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The UniGene system attempts to process the GenBank sequence data into
a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters. Each UniGene cluster
contains sequences that represent a unique gene, as well as related
information such as the tissue types in which the gene has been
expressed and map location. 
</P>

<H3>SGD
<A HREF="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/">genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/</A>
</H3>

</P>
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is a scientific database of
the molecular biology and genetics of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae.
</P>

<H3>EBI Genomes
<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/">www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/</A>
</H3>

<P>
This web site provides access and statistics for the completed
genomes, and information about ongoing projects.
</P>

<H3>Genome Biology
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genomes/index.html">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genomes/</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Genome Biology site at NCBI contains information about the
available complete genomes. 
</P>

<H3>Ensembl
<A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org/">www.ensembl.org</A>
</H3>

<P>
Ensembl is a joint project between EMBL-EBI and the Sanger Centre to
develop a software system which produces and maintains automatic
annotation of eukaryotic genomes.
