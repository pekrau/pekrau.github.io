<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">9. Systems for searching, indexing and cross-referencing</H1>

<P>
The usefulness of a database can be increased enormously if it is easy
to find entries that satisfy certain search criteria. Some examples of
searches that a scientist might want to do:
<UL>
<LI> All entries with the keyword "GTPase".
<LI> The entries which have a given literature reference (by author or
article).
<LI> All proteins with the keyword "ribosomal" from human (organism).
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The databases themselves may contain this information, but some
software systems must be used to actually perform this kind of
search. There are different ways of designing such systems, and two
examples are mentioned here.
</P>

<H2>SRS</H2>

<P>
<STRONG>The Sequence Retrieval System</STRONG> (SRS) developed by
Thure Etzold is a system for <STRONG>integrating heterogenous
databases</STRONG>. It is based on premade indexes of the items
(words, entries, data fields, text,...) found in a set of
documents (database files). Apart from the database files themselves,
the indexing procedure requires a grammar (Icarus) that describes what
different words in the data files  mean, how they are to be indexed,
and how they cross-reference to other items in other databases. SRS is
a web-oriented system located on a server which is accessed through
HTML pages and CGI scripts. 
</P>

<P>
SRS started as an academic project, but it is now a commercial system
developed and marketed by 
<A HREF="http://212.227.163.174/">LION Bioscience AG</A>. However,
academic groups can license the SRS system free of charge and set it
up at a server in their own lab.
</P>

<P>
EBI runs an <A HREF="http://srs.ebi.ac.uk">SRS service</A> which can
be used by  anyone. It indexes a large number of databases, and it
also provides a well-defined web interface which allows programs or
web sites to create links that query SRS at EBI.
</P>

<H2>Entrez</H2>

<P>
The Entrez system developed and accessible at the
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">NCBI Entrez
site</A>. Similar to some extent to the SRS system, it provides search
facilities for a large number of databases, and provides links between
them. It provides a well-defined web interface which allows programs
or web sites to define links that will query Entrez. 
</P>

<P>
However, it appears that the Entrez system is not available to set up
at one's own server. It is purely a system for accessing and searching
the databases at NCBI.
