<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">4. Database searching</H1>

<P>
When we have a sequence, and we want to find other sequences similar
to it in a database, we do not really need the full alignment of this
sequence against all others. All we want is a value, <STRONG>a
score</STRONG>, that will tell us how similar our probe sequence is to
the every other sequence. This score should be
<STRONG>sensitive</STRONG> (so that as many of the true homologs are
found) and <STRONG>specific</STRONG> (so that as few false positives
are hit).
</P>

<P>
There is a simple rule-of-thumb: A database hit having a
<STRONG>sequence identity of 25% or more (protein lengths 200 residues
or more) is almost certainly a true hit</STRONG>, if one uses
reasonable parameter settings for the common programs BLAST or
FASTA. There are cases where this is not true, for example when the
sequences have a high amount of low-complexity regions (Ser-Thr-rich
regions, and such), but this can usually be dealt with by applying a 
low-complexity filter.
</P>

<P>
But what to do about hits with lower degree of identity? The basic
problem is how to judge whether a score is significant or not. Could a
given score be the result of pure chance? The various search programs
(BLAST, FASTA) attempt to answer this question by computing an
<STRONG>expectation value</STRONG> (or something similar). This is an
estimate of the likelihood that a given hit is due to pure chance,
given the size of the database. This calculation uses probability
theory and various (reasonable) assumptions. It should be as low as
possible. If the value is close to 1 (say, 0.01) rather than 0.0 or
1.0e-45, then the hit is suspect.
