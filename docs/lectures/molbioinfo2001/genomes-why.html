<P>
A genome is the completely (or almost completely) determined DNA
sequence of the genetic material (chromosomes as well as any plasmids,
mitochondrial DNA, etc) of an organism. The word is somewhat of a
misnomer: a genome isn't the same as 'all genes', it is rather
'sequence of all DNA' wherein all genes can be found.
</P>

<P>
The first genome of a free living organism (viruses aside) was that of
<STRONG><I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> published in 1995</STRONG>
(<A HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/htbin-post/Entrez/query?uid=95350630&form=6&db=m&Dopt=r">Fleischmann
et al, Science (1995) vol 269, pp 496-512</A>).
</P>

<P>
Why are complete genomes interesting? The most basic answer to that
question is that <STRONG>we want to know the complete set of
genes</STRONG> that an organism has. The genome of an organism in a
certain sense the blueprint for that organism. Many observations and
experiments in biology involve mutants and mutations, and knowing the
complete set of genes for an organism can help with the analysis. For
example, we may want to be sure that a knocked-out gene does not have
a backup copy somewhere in the genome.
</P>

<P>
There is a deeper answer: knowing the complete genome for an organism
is <STRONG>only the first step in the complete mapping of the
constituents and processes of the organism</STRONG>. The complete
genome is a necessary (but not sufficient) requirement for
understanding an organism. 
</P>

<P>
And yet another answer to the question is emerging: the availability
of more and more complete genomes <STRONG>allows entirely new kinds of 
comparisons</STRONG> to be made between organism. New types of
analysis can be applied to old questions in biology, involving
problems in evolutionary history relating to the interactions between
species.
</P>

<P>
From the beginning of the genome era in 1995, there has been and is
still a strong element of competition in this field. Also, strong
commercial aspects are influencing the current climate. This was most
clearly illustrated by the competition and sometimes conflict between
the publicly funded 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/">Human Genome Project</A>, and
the company <A HREF="http://www.celera.com/">Celera Genomics
Corporation</A>.
</P>

<P>
However, the cost and effort required to sequence a genome, especially
a bacterial genome, is rapidly diminishing, as new and/or improved
technologies and tools are developed. We will soon find ourselves in a
situation where the availability of a genome is going to be considered
a basic requirement for working on a specific organism.
</P>

<P>
Currently (Jan 2001), on the order of 50-70 genomes have been
completed and published and are available. In the next few years, it
is likely that maybe one thousand genomes (mostly bacterial, but also
many higher organisms) will be available. The human genome is
available in large parts, although the finishing stage will continue
for some time.
