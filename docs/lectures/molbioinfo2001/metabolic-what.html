<P>
The availability of the complete genomes allow many new types of
experiments and analysis. The new approaches and questions that the
genomes make possible are usually referred to as <STRONG>functional 
genomics</STRONG>. The task is to define the function of a gene (or
its protein) in the life processes of the organism, where function
refers to the role it plays in a larger context.
</P>

<P>
But what are these life processes? The most obvious example is the
<STRONG>metabolism of an organism</STRONG>, the basic chemical system
that generates essential components such as amino acids, sugars and
lipids, and the energy required to synthesize them and to use them in
creating proteins and cellular structures. <STRONG>This system of
connected chemical reactions is a metabolic network</STRONG>.
</P>

<P>
Below is an example of such a network. This is the subsystem for
<STRONG>synthesis of the amino-acids valine, leucine and
isoleucine</STRONG>. This image was taken from the
<A HREF="http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/">KEGG database</A>. In the
<A HREF="http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/eco/eco00290.html">original
web page</A>, this image is clickable, so that one may navigate to
other, connected metabolic subsystems. The green boxes indicate
enzymes which have been identified in the organism, in this case
<I>Escherichia coli</I>.

<P>
<STRONG>Signalling networks</STRONG> are another kind of network (or
pathway) that are of central importance in biology. If the regulation
of genes are involved, one often talks about <STRONG>genetic
networks</STRONG>. Although the processes are different, and the types
of proteins and other molecules are different, the overall picture is
fairly similar: There are many components which interact in a
connected network.
</P>

<P>
Typically, metabolic and signalling networks are viewed as different
entities. <STRONG>In metabolic networks the flow of mass and energy
is the essential purpose</STRONG> of the machinery. <STRONG>In
signalling networks the purpose is the regulation of other
processes</STRONG>, and the use of energy and mass flow is a
requirement, but not really the point. However, there is an essential
component of regulation also in metabolic networks: The enzymes are
regulated through interactions with substrates and products so that
the appropriate conditions in the cell are upheld.
</P>

<P>
An important emerging field in bioinformatics is <STRONG>to understand 
metabolic and signalling networks in term of their function in the
organism</STRONG> and in relation to the data we already have. This
requires combining information from a large number of sources:
classical biochemistry, genomics, functional genomics (e.g. microarray 
experiments), network analysis, life process descriptions, and
simulation. <STRONG>A theory of the cell</STRONG> must combine the
descriptions of the structures in it (genome, proteome, subcellular
structures, etc) with a theoretical and computational description of
the dynamics of the life processes.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>One of the most important future challenges for
bioinformatics is how to make all this information comprehensible in
biological terms</STRONG>. This is necessary in order facilitate the
use of the information for <STRONG>predictive purposes</STRONG>. We
want to do more than just describe what is going on in an organism: We
also wish to be able to say what will happend given some specific set
of circumstances. This kind of predictive power will only be reached
if the complexity of biological processes can be handled
computationally.
