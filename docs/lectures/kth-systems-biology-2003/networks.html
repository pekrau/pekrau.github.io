Systems Biology is the study of life processes. The most fundamental
life process is the <STRONG>metabolism of an organism</STRONG>, the
basic chemical system that generates essential components such as
amino acids, sugars and lipids, and the energy required to synthesize
them and to use them in creating proteins and cellular
structures. <STRONG>The system of connected chemical reactions is a
metabolic network</STRONG>.
</P>

<P>
Below is an example of such a network. This is the subsystem for
<STRONG>synthesis of the amino-acids valine, leucine and
isoleucine</STRONG> in many living organisms. This image was taken
from the <A HREF="http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/">KEGG database</A>. In
the
<A HREF="http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway/eco/eco00290.html">original
web page</A>, this image is clickable, so that one may navigate to
other, connected metabolic subsystems. The green boxes indicate
enzymes which have been identified in the organism, in this case
<I>Escherichia coli</I>. The designations are the so-called <a
href="http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/">EC numbers</a> (defined
in the Enzyme Nomenclature publication), which is a hierarchical
system to classify enzymes according to the catalyzed chemical
reaction.

<STRONG>Signalling networks</STRONG> are another kind of network (or
pathway) that are of central importance in biology. If the regulation
of genes are involved, one often talks about <STRONG>genetic
networks</STRONG>. Although the processes are different, and the types
of proteins and other molecules are different, the overall picture is
fairly similar: There are many components which interact in a
connected network.
</P>

<P>
Typically, metabolic and signalling networks are viewed as different
entities. <STRONG>In metabolic networks the flow of mass and energy
is the essential purpose</STRONG> of the machinery. <STRONG>In
signalling networks the purpose is the regulation of other
processes</STRONG>, and the use of energy and mass flow is a
requirement, but not really the point. However, there is an essential
component of regulation also in metabolic networks: The enzymes are
regulated through interactions with substrates and products so that
the appropriate conditions in the cell are upheld.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>One of the most important future challenges for
bioinformatics is how to make all this information comprehensible in
biological terms</STRONG>. This is necessary in order facilitate the
use of the information for <STRONG>predictive purposes</STRONG>. We
want to do more than just describe what is going on in an organism: We
also wish to be able to say what will happend given some specific set
of circumstances. This kind of predictive power will only be reached
if the complexity of biological processes can be handled
computationally.
