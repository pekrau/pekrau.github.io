<p>
Systems Biology can be defined as an approach to biology where
organisms and <strong>biological processes</strong> should be analysed
and described in terms of their <strong>components and their
interactions</strong> in a framework of mathematical models.
</p>

<p>
In functional genomics one often uses statements such as 'gene or
protein X performs function Y', for example 'the leptin protein
regulates the amount of body fat'. But when one looks at this
statement, it is clear that it is fundamentally misleading. In the
given example, it is clear that the leptin protein is not a machine in
itself that computes and performs the regulatory action. Rather, the
leptin molecule is a component in a larger system, and it is that
system that performs the regulatory function.
</p>

</p>
Systems Biology begins in the insight that biological processes must
be understood in terms of the components that participate in the
processes, and that the complexity of biological systems make it
difficult, if not impossible, to understand the workings of the system
by simple qualitative arguments. <strong>Mathematically strict
models</strong> must be formulated. This is required both in order to
be able to capture the actual behaviour of the system with acceptable
precision, but also to be able to analyse the fundamental behaviour of
the system.
<p>

</p>
The mathematical models may be very simple (Boolean on/off), or very
complex (including detailed descriptions of interactions at a
molecular level). The important issue is that it should be possible to
analyse the model, either by some mathematical approach, or to
simulate it, in order to evaluate its correspondence with the observed
facts.
<p>

</p>
Paradoxically, the complexity of biology is the basis for the
development of Systems Biology, at the same time as it is the main
reason why computational approaches to biological processes have not
been particularly successful in the past. However, the appearance of
bioinformatics and functional genomics, and their results (complete
genomes, microarray expression analysis, etc) has had a great
impact. It now appears possible to obtain data that can be used to
build sensible models, and to test them. This is probably the main
reason why Systems Biology has become so popular in the last few
years.
<p>

<p>
So far, only very limited results have been obtained. There are only a
few, well-studied systems on which any deep analysis has been
done. However, there are already some insights that may prove to be
generally true. For instance, it seems clear that
<strong>robustness</strong> is a very important factor in biological
systems. This is the property that allows a system to absorb fairly
large perturbations, and still function reasonably well. The
functionally important behaviour of a system has a certain degree of
resilience to damage. Some studies have pointed to different ways in
which evolution have favoured systems that are robust in different
ways.
</p>

<p>
One important goal of Systems Biology is to understand life processes
in sufficient detail to <strong>make predictions about their
behaviour</strong>. If we want to make a particular system behave in a
certain way, how should we change the system, or what type of
perturbation should we apply? If we want to make a bacterium produce
propanol instead of ethanol, then how should we change the metabolic
network of the bacterium? Or, if we want to produce a pharmaceutical
drug that can help with deficiencies of the insulin regulatory system
that is the basis for diabetes type II (obesity-related diabetes),
what components should we focus on?  Which are the best drug targets?
