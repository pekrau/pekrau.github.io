<STRONG>The citric acid cycle</STRONG>, also called <STRONG>the Krebs
cycle</STRONG>, or <STRONG>TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle</STRONG>, is
a central part of the respiratory energy metabolism of many
organisms. A number of enzymes act on substrates in a cycle, where an
acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A is covalently added to
oxaloacetate and then converted into two molecules of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and reducing equivalents.

In one of the first experiments using <STRONG>microarrays</STRONG> for
monitoring gene expression changes (DeRisi, Iyer and Brown, Science
(1997) 278, 680-686), a yeast culture was allowed to grow in
glucose-rich medium until the glucose ran out. The metabolism then
changes from anaerobic fermentation of glucose to ethanol, to aerobic
metabolism of ethanol. This is the so-called <STRONG>diauxic
shift</STRONG>. The gene expression data shows a concerted change,
where the TCS cycle genes are up-regulated as the glucose level goes
down (red labels), at the same time as the glycolysis genes are
down-regulated (green).
