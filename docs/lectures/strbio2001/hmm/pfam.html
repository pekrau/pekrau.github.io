<P>
We have already mentioned the
<A HREF="http://www.cgb.ki.se/Pfam/">Pfam database</A> as a source of 
<A HREF="../multali/db.html">multiple alignments</A> for more than 2400
protein domain families. But what really makes Pfam useful is its
tight relationship with a program package that implements hidden
Markov models: <A HREF="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER</A>, which is
written by Sean Eddy.
</P>

<P>
The Pfam multiple alignments have been used to build HMMs for each and
every protein domain family. Using one of the programs in the HMMER
package, it is possible to search for the presence of a known domain
in a sequence of your own. The web sites for Pfam all have facilities
to do this via the Web. This is very useful, and the web sites
contains several different tools and search possibilities.
</P>

<P>
However, if one wishes to work on a multiple alignment of ones own,
and use that for searches, one must download the HMMER package and set
it up, which is pretty straightforward. The HMMER package contains
several different programs:
<UL>
<LI> hmmalign: Align a sequence to a given HMM profile.
<LI> hmmbuild: build a profile HMM from an alignment.
<LI> hmmcalibrate: calibrate HMM search statistics.
<LI> hmmpfam: search a single sequence against an HMM database.
<LI> hmmsearch: search a sequence database with a profile HMM.
</UL>
Of course, one can also download the entire Pfam database, if one
wants to change things, and perhaps include one's own experimental
alignments and HMMs.
</P>

<P>
Pfam itself is built using HMMER. The seed alignments in Pfam are used
to create an HMM, which is then used to identify all other sequences
that contain the domain in question. These are then used to build
automatically the full alignment.
</P>

<P>
There are several subtle issues when using HMMs, such as how to handle 
proteins with multiple domains, what to do about proteins with long,
uninteresting inserts before the proper domains appear, and partial
sequences containing only fragments of domains. The HMMER program has
its own particular ways of dealing with these problems, and it is
necessary to read the documentation for it if one needs to use
extensively for some project.
