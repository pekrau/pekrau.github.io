<H3>Use predefined lists</H3>

<P>
Not very common. Impractical: one may need 10<SUP>10</SUP> or
more numbers for a large simulation.
</P>

<H3>Use a physical device</H3>

<P>
Measurement of some random or chaotic physical process. Throw dice,
observe turbulence in air flow, observe fluctuations in a lava lamp
(<A HREF="http://www.lavarand.org/">yes, really</A>), use
radioactivity. Usually difficult to set up, and even more difficult to
verify that the distribution is not biased in some way. 
</P>

<H3>Use a computational iterative procedure</H3>

<P>
Design an algorithm that produces a series of seemingly random
numbers given some starting value(s) (seed).
</P>
<P>
Random number generators, RNGs. Often called pseudo-random number
generators to emphasize that the algorithm is really deterministic,
although the result is supposed to look random.
