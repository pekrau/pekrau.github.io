content: 'The focus of this multifaceted text is how the Open Society - a free, individualistic,
  diverse, dynamic society - can work given human nature and the complexity of the
  Open Society. It is organized as an investigation of what the author Gerald Gaus
  calls Friedrich Hayek''s three unsettling theses: 1) That human nature has a tribal
  and parochial egalitarian basis which fundamentally is in conflict with the Open
  Society, and must be kept in check by it. 2) The Open Society is too complex to
  be amenable to justification, i.e. rational analysis and criticism. 3) The complexity
  of the Open Society is such that conscious human control and governance is impossible.
  At most, the state can provide the framework for the openness of the Open Society.
  Basically, the project that Gaus embarks on is to make a more optimistic case for
  the Open Society by critically discussing, and to some extent refuting Hayek''s
  theses.


  Gaus'' argument concerning Hayek''s first thesis takes into account the advances
  in understanding of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens that has taken place
  during the last 30 or so years. He notes that the idea that morality has sprung
  out of the needs of the hypersocial human animal during its evolution has become
  commonplace. In Gaus'' view, political philosophy must now be discussed with explicit
  reference to human nature as nowadays understood in an evolutionary context. This
  includes the fact that humans are a fundamentally cultural species, which has many
  important ramifications. Gaus argues that human sociality is based on cooperation
  and that there are strong forces in it that drive towards inclusion, impartiality
  and self-organization which Hayek did not take into account, and which undermine
  Hayek''s first thesis that human nature is at odds with the Open Society.


  Gaus'' argument on the second and third of Hayek''s theses uses a range of arguments
  from different fields. It is a complex text, which is hard to summarize. It has
  many interesting threads, and requires much thinking on the part of the reader.
  The upshot is that Hayek did have many valid points, but that there is actually
  considerable space for both critical evaluation of society, and for attempts at
  reforming it consciously.


  Although Gaus uses the term Open Society, which Karl Popper made famous, his account
  is almost wholly based on Hayek''s evolutionary view of a free society - what Hayek
  called the Great Society. Although he refers to Popper in some passages, he is clear
  that he considers Hayek''s analysis superior to Popper''s. But, somewhat strangely,
  Gaus ends up in a position which is more similar to Popper''s; he does not use the
  term, but he views social engineering - which Popper argued for - in a more positive
  light than Hayek. Now, it is clear that Popper did not flesh out his analysis of
  the Open Society very much; Gaus does a lot more work in this regard. But still,
  some discussion about the fact that Gaus'' position ends up closer to Popper than
  to Hayek would have been useful.


  The text is dense, and it draws on arguments from a broad range of scientific fields,
  such as anthropoly, primatology, psychology, cultural studies of various kinds,
  economics, game theory and complexity theory. This makes the book rather hard to
  read, even though the language in itself is not that difficult. There is just so
  much in it! Some issues are investigated through formalized analysis, which occasionally
  provides more clarity, in others not. This book cannot be recommended to the average
  politically interested person. Someone else needs to write a popular version of
  Gaus'' account.


  In these days, when the Open Society is threatened from many directions, it is somewhat
  startling to read the end of Gaus'' text, where he is confident about the future:
  "For a time, opponents of diversity and openness may check exploration, creativity,
  diversity, and freedom, but the forces propelling the new civilization proclaimed
  by Popper and Hayek cannot long be contained." It should be noted that Popper did
  not take this for granted at all. One may hope that Gaus'' optimistic conclusion
  will turn out to be well-founded.
