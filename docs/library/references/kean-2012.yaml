content: 'A fun read, but a little too much like a dinner conversation: Somewhat sensationalistic
  stories. In some parts, where I know the details, I noticed that the author actually
  didn''t quite understand some of the aspects. He does not seem to know his chemistry
  well. But no major disasters.'
