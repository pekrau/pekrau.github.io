authors:
- Goodhart, David
content: A must-read for understanding the problems of the current political era.
  The thesis of the book is that the anywheres (educated, accomplished, high-performance
  urban liberals) have dominated politics and debate, and that the somewheres (rooted,
  conservative, less-educated workers) have become disenchanted with the development
  of society and are resentful that their views have been discounted.  This conflict
  cannot simply be dismissed. Some kind of resolution must be found.
