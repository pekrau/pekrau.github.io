content: A very good read, this retelling of the classical Greek myths. One fascinating
  aspect is the very different idea of godhood compared to the judeo-christian concept.
  The Greek gods are real persons (so to speak), and quite capricious and moody. They
  are like morally deficient variants of Hollywood superheroes; they don&#39;t really
  care all that much about morally good deeds. An interesting similarity is that superheroes
  aren&#39;t interesting unless they have a weak spot, like kryptonite for Superman. In
  the Greek gods&#39; case, it is the rule that no god can revoke the divine command or
  curse of another god. Numerous stories revolve around this fundamental constraint.
