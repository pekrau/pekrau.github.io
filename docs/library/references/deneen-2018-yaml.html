content: &#39;Deneen&#39;&#39;s thesis is that the current malaise of liberalism is mainly due
  to inherent consequences of liberal ideas themselves. As these ideas and values
  have successively been influencing society, their unintended but necessary effects
  are the problems we face today: populism, alienation, commercialism, depletion of
  the environment, income inequality, etc. He makes the point that there is no easy
  way of fixing liberalism, since the causes of the problems are in the roots of liberalism
  itself. If there is one stylistic problem with the book, it is that he makes this
  point far too many times.


  Although I think there is some merit to the argument that the current problems of
  liberalism are due to its fundamentals, Deneen does not seem to realize that his
  argument proves too much. He states that at least some liberal ideas stem from Christian
  thinking, but if that is the case, did not those original ideas also contain in
  themselves the same self-destructive potential that he attributes to liberalism?
  Is it perhaps so that those Christian thoughts also contained in themselves the
  seeds of secularism and of liberal developments? This is at any rate the thesis
  proposed by Larry Siedentop in his &#34;Inventing the Individual&#34;, which I have reviewed
  briefly in this site. If Deneen had read Siedentop, he would have had a more difficult
  time portraying the emergence of liberalism as a fall from the communitarian Eden
  of previous times. Incidentally, it is hard to figure out when that Eden was supposed
  to have existed. Sometimes, Deneen seems to locate this Eden in the New England
  as described by Tocqueville, but at other times one gets the impression that he
  is talking about pre-renaissance times.


  Towards the end of his book, Deneen does grudgingly accept that liberalism does
  represent some kind of advance. Although he is unable to say this without reiterating
  his withering contempt for liberalism, he is explicit that there can be no turning
  back. He has a very hard time proposing an alternative. He describes rather vaguely
  a so-called Benedictine option, a kind of low-key communitarian practical living
  that attempts to carve out a space outside of modern society. A community basing
  its life on organic tradition is to be achieved by explicit design. Deneen is conscious
  of the inherent contradiction of this proposal. So, the book is a failure, but an
  interesting one.&#39;
