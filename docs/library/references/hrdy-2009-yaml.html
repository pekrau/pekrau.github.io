content: A very good description of the theories and investigations that focus on
  the nurturing of infants as a central aspect of human evolution. A mother simply
  cannot bring up a child all on her own, she needs a lot of assistance and collaboration
  from other mothers, fathers, relatives, older children, grandmothers and so on.
  How did this dependency come about? What does it entail, and what are the consequences?
  This book summarizes the research in this field up to 2008. It should be required
  reading for anyone interested in how humanity works.
