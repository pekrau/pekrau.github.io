authors:
- Popper, Karl
content: 'A little gem of a book in the form of two essays from the last few years
  of Karl Popper''s life.


  In the first essay, Popper presents a new view of causality, involving the notion
  of propensities. This is a view that marries Popper''s indeterminism with a realist
  stance that events and processes are properties of the world.


  In the second essay, he discusses his evolutionary approach to the problem of knowledge,
  in which he shows that even the earliest life forms can be interpreted as being
  based on knowledge, and embodying theories of how the environment behaves and how
  it can be used. This approach stresses the active nature of life and knowledge-seeking,
  debunking the idea that knowledge comes in the form of streams of data that the
  organism passively receives.'
