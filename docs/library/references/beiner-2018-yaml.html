content: A brief book about the antiliberalism of Nietzsche and Heidegger. It is currently
  common to assume that Nietzsche and Heidegger provide a radical criticism of modernity
  (liberalism, capitalism, Enlightenment) that can be used for &#34;leftist&#34; purposes.
  The author drives home the simple fact that their criticism is fundamentally reactionary,
  which is very naturally being used by current far-right ideologues such as Aleksandr
  Dugin. The book assumes too much familiarity on part of the reader with Nietzsche.
  The part about Heidegger is much better, and renders a plausible brief description
  of his ideas, and, importantly, the problem that is the driving force behind Heidegger&#39;s
  thinking. It is here that Heidegger&#39;s nazism becomes understandable. Beiner shows
  convincingly that there is no way to separate Heidegger&#39;s philosophy from his political
  ideas.
