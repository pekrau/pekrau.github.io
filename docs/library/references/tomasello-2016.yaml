content: 'A magisterial synthesis of empirical results and philosophical arguments
  concerning anthropology, sociology, human psychology and evolutionary history. How
  can human morality be the product of the seemingly amoral process of evolution?
  The discussion is grounded in empirical results concerning the common and divergent
  behaviors of human children and chimpanzees (our nearest evolutionary relative).
  The focus in this book is on how cooperation, joint intentionality and fairness
  based on other-self equivalence eventually has evolved into morality. The argument
  draws a long, winding curve through the dots provided by the empirical results and
  philosophical considerations.


  This was not an easy read. I had to go slowly, carefully thinking about what the
  theory and arguments state. But it was certainly rewarding. I have changed my views
  on the "naturalness" of equality, and of how social norms work, and why they are
  so important.'
