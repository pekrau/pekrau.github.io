content: 'Finally! I''ve managed to get through this rather tedious and badly organized
  book. In the process I have become allergic to the phrases "enriched view", "recent
  scholarship" and "surely it is time to move on", which are repeated ad nauseam.


  I intend to write more about the arguments and views of this book elsewhere, suffice
  it to say that it does not convince. The idea that science is enriched by religion
  is stated multiple times, but nowhere is any credible example given.


  Also, it is rather strange in this day and age to read a book that equates religion
  with Christianity. As far as I can tell, only hinduism and buddhism are mentioned
  (both in a derogatory context), and islam not at all. How can this kind of myopia
  still persist?'
