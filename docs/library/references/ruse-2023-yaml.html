content: &#34;Michael Ruse is an old hand in the philosophy of biology. He is eminently\
  \ qualified to write this short book. An important attraction of it is the account\
  \ of the history of the idea of natural selection. He argues that even though Darwin\
  \ was clear about the importance of natural selection in accounting for evolution,\
  \ many others, both in the 19th century and later, have construed its role differently.\
  \ \n\nUnfortunately, the book leans too heavily on explicating the history of ideas\
  \ in general, and Darwin&#39;s account in particular. It spends less effort on giving\
  \ an overall picture of the current state of knowledge. Also, the text should have\
  \ been edited more thoroughly. I am also somewhat puzzled that some of the quotes\
  \ Ruse uses do not really illustrate what he claims that they do. I do not think\
  \ he fundamentally misrepresents the arguments of the authors he criticizes, it&#39;s\
  \ just that the quotes he uses in some cases simply do not seem relevant to the\
  \ argument he makes.\n\nThe discussion about the rival \&#34;root\&#34; (!) metaphors of\
  \ mechanism and organicism is very clear, and is by itself as good reason to read\
  \ the book.&#34;

html: &#39;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ruse is an old hand in the philosophy of biology. He is eminently
  qualified to write this short book. An important attraction of it is the account

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the book leans too heavily on explicating the history of ideas
  in general, and Darwin&#39;&#39;s account in particular. It spends less effort on giving
  an overall picture of the current state of knowledge. Also, the text should have
  been edited more thoroughly. I am also somewhat puzzled that some of the quotes
  Ruse uses do not really illustrate what he claims that they do. I do not think he
  fundamentally misrepresents the arguments of the authors he criticizes, it&#39;&#39;s just
  that the quotes he uses in some cases simply do not seem relevant to the argument
  he makes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The discussion about the rival &amp;quot;root&amp;quot; (!) metaphors of mechanism and
  organicism is very clear, and is by itself as good reason to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;
