content: This was a frustrating book. Lots of interesting facts and observations with
  references, and usually correct (whenever I could judge it). But the text has absolutely
  no structure at all. It's as if they had lots of short news messages that they copy-pasted
  together without any overarching story or idea. If you are looking for the occasional
  fun fact, then maybe it is worth reading. Otherwise not.
