content: This is a pamphlet urging a rethink of liberal politics. Although it is written
  almost entirely from the perspective of the US political scene, it does have som
  relevance to liberals everywhere. Lilla makes the case that today's identity politics  is
  actually a non-political movement following naturally in the tracks of Reagan's
  individualist conservative revolution. Liberals need to rediscover proper political
  action that can have a chance of success at the ballot box. Lilla proposes that
  the concept of citizenship should be the central organizing principle. However,
  what concrete policies should be goal of this rethought liberal movement is left
  unspecified.
