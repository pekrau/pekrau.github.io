content: &#39;An easy read containing some interesting information on human evolution
  and politics. Nicholas Wade does make some valid and/or provoking points. But his
  book is ultimately disappointing. It is simply not well thought through. Wade argues
  for his thesis that human genetics, as formed by evolution, determines how society
  and politics works. But his text is muddled and incoherent, and it is too often
  rather lazily argued. This is a text with an axe to grind. There is no sense of
  intellectual curiosity; the book lacks a will to explore.


  Wade correctly criticizes those anthropologists and sociologists who deny any role
  for genetics or evolution in understanding the behaviour of humans. His response
  is unfortunately to take the equally absurd position that genetics and evolution
  determines everything. Institutions are &#34;mere extensions of behaviours that evolution
  has programmed into the genome&#34;. And yet those institutions can in some cases somehow
  be directly contrary to human nature? Time and again, Wade illustrates that culture
  affects human societies to an extraordinary degree, yet he maintains that genetics
  rules.


  In more than a few instances the text contradicts itself within the space of less
  than one page. On page 131, the threat of human extinction is &#34;based not on the
  precarious extrapolations of computer models but on a profound demographic change...&#34;
  Later on the same page: &#34;Birth rates are hard to predict.&#34; On page 149: &#34;elite schools
  [are] forced to broaden their intake...&#34;. Two paragraphs later: &#34;universities have
  become more selective.&#34;


  The fundamental flaw in Wade&#39;&#39;s argument is that it views human nature as something
  like a cage: &#34;Lasting solutions will be found only within the framework of human
  nature.&#34; His insistence that culture and politics are mere extensions of evolutionary
  traits is, ironically, similar to the thoroughly debunked Marxist idea that culture
  and politics is just a superstructure on top of the economic system, fully determined
  by it, and not really of any consequence. The seemingly obvious alternative solution
  that genetics and culture can co-exist and affect each other and society is not
  seriously discussed.


  The relationships between human society, culture, politics and human evolution are
  very interesting and important. It is a shame that this topic didn&#39;&#39;t get a better
  treatment.&#39;
