content: 'This book discusses a vast number of subjects, and although it is thought-provoking
  and fun to read, it is also simultaneously frustrating. All too rarely does it go
  into sufficient depth with the ideas, theories or suggestions it presents. The book
  covers too much.


  That said, its discussion of the vital importance of cooperation, collaboration
  and culture for humans is good. The thesis that intelligence in humans is fundamentally
  a culturally based trait is well argued. Another interesting part is the discussion
  about the constraints for human society given by the availability of useful energy
  sources.


  An example of a provocative point that is less successfully presented is the idea
  of using block-chain technology for smart social contracts as a means of updating
  governance and democracy. The discussion here is fundamentally naive, simply stating
  repeatedly that smart contracts are self-enforcing. Sorry, but the social contract
  cannot be reduced to a matter of software code.


  All in all, an interesting, but not very satisfactory read.'
