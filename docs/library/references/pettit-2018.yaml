content: 'The title of this book by Philip Pettit points to an intriguing and important
  question. As the subtitle has it, the goal of the book is "reconstructing the role
  and nature of morality." It attempts to analyze how ethics came into being. How
  did humans invent, or discover, ethics? A description of how ethics fits in with
  human evolution could potentially tell us a lot about both humans and ethics. But
  the way this book goes about it does not, in my mind, deliver the goods. The starting
  point is not very believable, and the explicit constraints put on the narrative
  by the author do not help. The result is disappointing. In fact, the most useful
  part of the book is the criticism of its main text by Michael Tomasello in a short
  section at the end.


  The narrative begins with Erewhon, a hypothetical human society in which people
  can communicate by natural language, but in which ethics or morality as such does
  not exist. Pettit is explicit that this is a thought experiment. Erewhon has not
  actually existed. The question Pettit poses is: Given this state, how has ethics
  emerged? In my mind, this makes his narrative vulnerable to the same kind of criticism
  that can be leveled at John Rawls theory of justice, or for that matter at any hypothetical
  tale of how a social contract has been arrived at. The starting point is always
  open to criticism: Why define the starting point in exactly those terms? There is
  always the worry that the starting point has been designed to produce the justification
  of a particular moral theory that one desires. That is, the argument is not really
  a derivation from axioms, as it purports to be, but rather a construction of a particular
  set of axioms that gives the requested result.


  Pettit posits several constraints on the narrative: it must be naturalistic, i.e.
  it cannot invoke any supernatural interventions. Fair enough; we are not interested
  in yet another explanation of ethics that tries to avoid Euthyphro''s dilemma as
  stated by Plato. Another constraint is that the narrative must not rely on luck.
  Pettit view is that the emergence of ethics from within Erewhon must be a process
  that more or less inevitably had to follow. To rely on luck for this process to
  occur would be a kind of cheating, is my interpretation. To some extent, I can understand
  why Pettit imposes this constraint. But this unfortunately means that the theory
  will be proving too much. Evolution, in actual fact, and the emergence of novel
  features that it entails, contains an essential component of randomness, luck if
  you will. At no point in the evolutionary history of the ancestors of us humans
  was it inevitable that Homo sapiens would emerge. Therefore the idea that a narrative
  of how ethics emerged must rely on inevitability is too strong. It proves too much.


  Tomasello''s criticism of Pettit''s text relates to the issue of cooperation. When
  Pettit starts his narrative with the existence of human language as a means of communication,
  Tomasello asks whether it is not in fact cooperation that was the starting point
  for why we even invented language. In his view, morality starts with the problems
  caused by cooperation, and language is a secondary issue in that respect. I notice
  that the cover of the book shows a painting "Group of five men working with a net".
  The men are not primarily talking, they are collaborating.


  The book is not an easy text to read. At times, it seems that there is no progress
  in the argument, simply a stating and restating of a number of thesis, again and
  again. It has a number of words that recur in a vast array of permutations, such
  as "desiderata", "avowal" and "pledging". There is a lot of splitting up of issues
  into multiple subarguments in ways that do not contribute to clarity. Given the
  weakness of the argument, I cannot really recommend it.'
