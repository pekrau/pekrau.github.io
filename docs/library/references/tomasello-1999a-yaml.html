content: &#39;Based on empirical research involving humans and great apes, Michael Tomasello
  proposes that human language emerged from the need for communication as part of
  collaboration. Collaboration and shared intentionality that it came to entail, was
  the basis. He does not think that language began as vocalizations, since the ability
  to refer to specific things is required, and how does one indicate that using just
  sound without a prior basis of meaning? Instead, gestures, and in particular pointing,
  is more likely as the precursor of language, in Tomasello&#39;&#39;s view.


  Human communication is based on biological adaptions to the need for cooperative
  social interaction, and it relies heavily of cultural inheritance. Tomasello does
  not think that Chomsky&#39;&#39;s theory of innate grammar really provides much explanatory
  power. Instead, the focus should be in shared intentionality and the transmitting
  of cultural innovations.


  I found this to be a more accessible text than usual for Tomasello. Not that he
  is usually difficult to understand, rather that his texts usually have rather high
  density. This one was a little lighter.&#39;
