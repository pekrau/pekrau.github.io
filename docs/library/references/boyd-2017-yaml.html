content: &#39;Robert Boyd has done ground-breaking research on the evolution of Homo sapiens
  focusing on the role of culture. Being individually smart has traditionally been
  the explanation for why humans have succeeded in thriving in almost any environment
  on Earth. Boyd makes the case that this cannot be the whole truth, and maybe not
  even the main reason. Instead, our sociality combined with our cumulative culture
  are the key elements. Our adherence to and enforcement of cultural norms creates
  conditions where selection between cultural groups produces adaption to local environments
  in true Darwinian fashion.


  In this book, Boyd summarizes a research program that has successfully combined
  anthropology, archaeology, evolutionary theory, game theory and formal mathematical
  modeling and simulation. The book is surprisingly easy to read. The inclusion of
  short essays with critical comments from four scientists, together with a reply
  from Boyd, makes this an excellent introduction into a fascinating field.&#39;
