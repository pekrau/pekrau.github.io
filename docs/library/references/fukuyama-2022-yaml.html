authors:
- Fukuyama, Francis
content: &#39;A pretty good text on the decline of liberalism in world politics in recent
  years. Many of the problems are related to the unintentional effects of policies
  that have been called liberal, sometimes accurately, sometimes not. Fukuyama defines
  liberalism as arguing &#34;for the limitation of the powers of government through law
  and ultimately constitutions, creating institutions protecting the rights of individuals...&#34;
  Fukuyama criticizes neoliberalism as an economic liberalism that has increased inequality
  and directly or indirectly caused many of the issues besetting liberalism today.
  He points out that the threats to liberal democracy comes in different ways from
  both the left and the right.


  Fukuyama discusses the issues of equality, dignity, individualism, diversity and
  pluralism, and the ways these simultaneously reinforce and conflict with one another.
  He is refreshingly candid about the difficulties involved in maintaining a society
  that balances these values. He is scathing about the neoconservatism of Patrick
  Deneen, Yoram Hazony and others. He expertly analyses the various aspects of identity
  politics. His comments on post-modern thinking by Michel Foucault and others illuminates
  the connections with both sides of the current so-called culture wars. The discussion
  of national identity acknowledges the dangers of nationalism but also recognizes
  that &#34;national identity is a social construct, and it can be shaped to support rather
  than undermine liberal values.&#34; He thinks liberals should be more proud of national
  identity when it refers to an open society.


  His conclusions for a defense of a liberal society include stating a number of liberal
  principles, which I do not discuss here; that would require at least an entire essay.
  The final word in Fukyama&#39;&#39;s book goes to the value of moderation, a value espoused
  by the ancient Greeks, among others. The quest for the totality of some value in
  politics may be most fundamental error of our age.&#39;
