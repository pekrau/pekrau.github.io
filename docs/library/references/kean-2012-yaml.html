- Kean, Sam
content: &#39;A fun read, but a little too much like a dinner conversation: Somewhat sensationalistic
  stories. In some parts, where I know the details, I noticed that the author actually
  didn&#39;&#39;t quite understand some of the aspects. He does not seem to know his chemistry
  well. But no major disasters.&#39;
