authors:
- Church, George
- Regis, Ed
content: Interesting and though-provoking. However, the book is marred by the fact
  that one of its main themes is actually rather silly. Church proposes creating life
  that is based on the mirror-images of the common enantiomers of the biological building
  blocks. He glosses over the fact that this would entail having to recreate an entire
  ecology of mirror-image organisms to sustain it. And the purported benefits are
  in no way commensurate with that colossal task.
