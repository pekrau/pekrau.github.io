- Sperber, Dan
content: &#39;A magnificently thought-provoking book. It starts from the question: If
  rationality is so great, why hasn&#39;&#39;t evolution furnished it to more than one species,
  and why has that species (Homo sapiens) got it in such apparently damaged way? Human
  irrationality is well documented. If rationality is so great, why hasn&#39;&#39;t it vanquished
  our more primitive aspects?


  I am not going to write about the arguments and conclusions of the book here. I
  need time to digest it and produce a more reasoned (ha!) text.&#39;
