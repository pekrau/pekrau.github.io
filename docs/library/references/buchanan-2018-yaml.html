content: &#34;A well-written and well-argued account of a theory of moral progress. The\
  \ writing is lucid, albeit a little too often rehashing the same points several\
  \ times.\n\nStarting with a morality based on reciprocity and cooperation in groups,\
  \ the idea is that morality can expand from in-group/out-group thinking to include\
  \ others as well, if certain conditions hold. The authors consider different examples\
  \ and kinds of moral progress, but concentrate on the inclusion of additional moral\
  \ agents, such as the argument of the 19th century abolitionists working against\
  \ slavery that Africans have moral standing. The book uses human rights thinking\
  \ as the main example.\n\nThe authors argue against what they call the evoconservative\
  \ position: that humans are incorrigibly group-centered and that any attempts to\
  \ greater inclusivity is an aberration which cannot be sustained. Importantly, the\
  \ authors make the case that human moral psychology must be viewed in the light\
  \ of the concept of plasticity, i.e. that the humans (and other organisms) have\
  \ a range of possible behaviors which are activated depending on the concrete environment\
  \ they encounter. If humans live in an environment of strife and strong competition,\
  \ then in-group/out-group thinking becomes more dominant. When conditions favor\
  \ cooperation and win-win scenarios, moral psychology can become more inclusive.\
  \ Moral progress has a material, or naturalistic, foundation.\n\nThere are a few\
  \ confusing points. In some places, the authors seem to argue that progress in moral\
  \ thinking, e.g. arguments and debates about consistency in moral views, are insufficient\
  \ to explain moral progress in general. Other times, the authors seem to suggest\
  \ that it is exactly these debates that are being made possible by social developments.\
  \ They say that their view is biological and naturalistic, and criticize cultural\
  \ evolution as a concept. But if the logical content of moral argument has any force\
  \ at all, then there must be cultural innovation and evolution, it seems to me.\
  \  \n\nOne of the most interesting points of the book is that moral progress must\
  \ entail epistemic humility. We should not try to formulate the ultimate morality,\
  \ since we cannot know what innovations in morality might happen in the future.\
  \ If we look back in history, there are many cases of social features that were\
  \ considered moral, or non-moral, which we have now completely re-evaluated. Examples\
  \ of features that have undergone fundamental changes in moral reasoning include\
  \ slavery, dueling, sexual minorities, and the roles of men and women. We cannot\
  \ presume to know what changes may occur in the future, so instead of trying to\
  \ formulate the ultimate good, we should focus on improving morality, both the views\
  \ of morality and its implementation.&#34;
