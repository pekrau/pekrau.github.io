authors:
- Enriquez, Juan
- Gullans, Steve
content: Many interesting examples and references. Unfortunately, the writing is sloppy
  and imprecise, at times misleading. Intellectual coherence would have been nice.
  I was disappointed. I suspect the authors could do better if they really put some
  effort into it.
