content: A very good read, this retelling of the classical Greek myths. One fascinating
  aspect is the very different idea of godhood compared to the judeo-christian concept.
  The Greek gods are real persons (so to speak), and quite capricious and moody. They
  are like morally deficient variants of Hollywood superheroes; they don't really
  care all that much about morally good deeds. An interesting similarity is that superheroes
  aren't interesting unless they have a weak spot, like kryptonite for Superman. In
  the Greek gods' case, it is the rule that no god can revoke the divine command or
  curse of another god. Numerous stories revolve around this fundamental constraint.
