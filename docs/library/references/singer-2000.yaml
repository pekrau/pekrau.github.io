content: A small gem of a text. Lucidly makes the case that Darwinian thinking can
  be combined with a leftist political stance. However, this requires that some cherished
  traditional leftist views are jettisoned, among them the idea of the perfectability
  of society and the idea that human nature is infinitely malleable or completely
  determined by the social and cultural environment.
