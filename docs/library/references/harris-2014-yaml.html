- Harris, Eugene E
content: A very good description of the current state of science regarding our human
  and primate ancestors, from about 2 million years ago and to the present. Discusses
  the &#34;out of Africa&#34; hypothesis, the interaction between Homo sapiens and the Neanderthals,
  and the scientific theory and data behind it. Especially interesting for me was
  the description of the former battle between the fossil and the genetic approaches
  to paleontology, which has now basically been resolved in favour of genomes. However,
  the importance of fossils has been tremendously increased by the new methods for
  obtaining genome data from old bones. It nicely complements Karin Bojs recent book
  (in Swedish only, so far).
