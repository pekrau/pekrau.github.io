content: A brief book about the antiliberalism of Nietzsche and Heidegger. It is currently
  common to assume that Nietzsche and Heidegger provide a radical criticism of modernity
  (liberalism, capitalism, Enlightenment) that can be used for "leftist" purposes.
  The author drives home the simple fact that their criticism is fundamentally reactionary,
  which is very naturally being used by current far-right ideologues such as Aleksandr
  Dugin. The book assumes too much familiarity on part of the reader with Nietzsche.
  The part about Heidegger is much better, and renders a plausible brief description
  of his ideas, and, importantly, the problem that is the driving force behind Heidegger's
  thinking. It is here that Heidegger's nazism becomes understandable. Beiner shows
  convincingly that there is no way to separate Heidegger's philosophy from his political
  ideas.
