authors:
- Fukuyama, Francis
content: &#39;It is very interesting to read this 35 years after its first version (as
  an article) was published. Its main prediction - that liberalism is the logical
  end-point of history, which has been, and will be, reached by more and more nations
  - has failed, given the election 2024 of the illiberal Donald Trump as president
  in the USA, and the other numerous anti-liberal developments globally during the
  last few years.


  The book has many valid and interesting points. However, given its failure, the
  framework underpinning it, namely Hegel&#39;&#39;s theory of historical progress as interpreted
  by Alexandre Kojéve, and the use of &#34;thymos&#34;, or recognition of person-hood, looks
  decidedly dated. More seriously, the fundamental idea in this book of a Universal
  History is confused. Sometimes Universal History is discussed as if it is an objective
  process occurring in the world, while at other times it is seen as a way of interpreting
  what is going on. These are fundamentally different concepts, but Fukuyama swerves
  between the two as he sees fit.


  There is a comment somewhere to the effect that Hegel was constrained by the views
  of his time, and the same can be said of this book. Having read Fukuyama&#39;&#39;s recent
  book &#34;Liberalism and its discontents&#34;, I am now struck by how the author in that
  book has completely abandoned the argumentative framework from the first book. I
  wonder if he has anywhere commented on why he did that...


  This book is clearly written, and an interesting testament from an epoch that is
  now gone.&#39;
