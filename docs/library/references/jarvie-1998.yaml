content: 'A rather uneven collection of papers, some contributions highly interesting,
  others less so. The preface (new in this edition) by the editors, and the contributions
  by Ian Jarvie (the ideas of open and closed societies as ideal types), John Hall
  (the sociological deficit of The Open Society) and Bryan Magee (the uses of Popper
  for a practical politician) are the most interesting. The paper by Joseph Agassi
  (The notions of the modern nation-state: Popper and nationalism) was tantalizing,
  but was ultimately unsatisfactory.'
