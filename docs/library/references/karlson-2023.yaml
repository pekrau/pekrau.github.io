content: 'This is a well-written book, yet terrible. It describes the arguments for
  liberalism well. But it is terrible because it does not manage to rise over the
  level of a propaganda piece. The analysis of populism makes interesting points,
  but it ultimately fails to explain why liberalism has waned and populists have become
  so successful in the last 20 or so years. The recipe for countering populism is
  basically just "more neoliberalism".


  One reason for this failure is that the author seems incapable of entertaining the
  thought that liberal ideas, policies and government may have internal contradictions
  and unintended consequences that undermine it. The call for a revival of "classical
  liberalism" is entirely misguided. Reviving a corpse just produces a zombie. Any
  attempt at revivification of an ideology will inevitably transform it. Indeed, the
  "decent classical liberalism" Karlson advocates bears an uncanny similarity to social
  liberalism.


  This book is a failure, and the fact that so many liberals seem to like it is a  sign
  that liberals do not understand how bad the situation is. Being a liberal myself,
  I despair at our inability to face up to reality and reconsider our thinking in
  depth.'
