content: 'Argues for the hypothesis that human cooperation and culture must be viewed
  in an evolutionary context. Genetic and cultural evolution are two parallel processes
  that have affected the emergence of modern Homo sapiens. The propensity for culture
  has created a new environment for human genetic evolution. The authors discuss the
  limits of the usual explanations for human cooperation: kinship, reciprocity and
  game theory. These are valid, but insufficient, to explain all phenomena regarding
  human culture and cooperation. I find the exposition very readable. It combines
  an ethnography of the Chaldeans in Detroit with a review of the theoretical framework
  proposed by the authors.'
