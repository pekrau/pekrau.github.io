authors:
- Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft
content: The classic, in an edition based on the 1818 version, with annotation highlighting
  changes in the 1831 version. Surprisingly readable. This is one of the few truly
  iconic stories of the modern Western culture. An essential aspect of Shelley's monster
  is that he is not evil at the time of creation. It is his abandonment by his creator,
  Victor Frankenstein, that ignites his fury and makes him thirst for revenge. So
  is Frankenstein's crime really one of creating the unnatural, or of abandoning his
  creation?
