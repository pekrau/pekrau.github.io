- Tomasello, Michael
content: This is a review and synthesis of Michael Tomasello&#39;s and others&#39; studies
  on what differentiates the human species from its closest evolutionary ancestors,
  the great apes. He describes the development of the human child and its abilities
  from birth to 6 years of age, and contrasts it to the abilities of mainly chimpanzees.
  It is during this time that most, if not all, capabilities that makes humans human
  manifest themselves. It&#39;s a story of how the hypersocial nature of humans is made
  possible by evolutionary changes in various capabilities that in some form or another
  existed already in the last common ancestor of humans and great apes. These changes
  eventually produced a species for which accumulative culture, language, cooperation
  and reason are rooted in biology, but at the same time go far beyond biology. Tomasello
  calls this the &#34;shared intentionality theory&#34;, since it relies heavily on the notion
  of shared intentionality, in which two or more individuals share a common goal and
  understanding in a situation, and they understand that the other understands this
  also. This develops into collective intentionality, which is essentially human culture.
  The text is dense, so this is not an easy read. But it is rewarding, inspiring and
  provocative.
