content: &#39;An impassioned plea for liberals to look critically at liberalism&#39;&#39;s responsibility
  for the current failures of western society. Given Hungary, Poland, Trump and Brexit,
  to mention just a few of the most recent disasters, it is clear that there is a
  problem. Zielonka drives home the thesis that liberals and liberalism to a large
  extent is to blame for these developments. Liberals cannot avoid looking critically
  at themselves. A reappraisal is required. I agree.


  However, I do not agree with every aspect of Zielonka&#39;&#39;s analysis, but that is to
  be expected. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, his pointers towards a new liberalism are
  vague. The first step must be to realize that there is a problem. This book, and
  others, show that there is a global, or at least western, debate about these issues.
  I notice that Sweden, where I live, has nothing in this vein. This is a disaster
  in its own right.&#39;
