content: As good an exposition of formal ontology has one could possibly get. Clear,
  methodical, and explicit about the philosophical underpinnings. It lacks a critique
  of the computational aspects. In my opinion, ontologies are not sufficiently integrated
  with the web. They are usually available as file dumps for loading into stand-alone
  software tools, while it seems obvious to me that an ontology should be first and
  foremost defined as a web service.
