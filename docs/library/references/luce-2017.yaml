authors:
- Luce, Edward
content: 'Luce makes the case that liberals must face the uncomfortable truth: That
  many of its problems and setbacks are the results of its own actions. On top of
  that, developments such as the rise of China will further reduce the domain of liberalism
  globally. Liberals must think anew. Luce writes well, but the book is highly journalistic,
  being light on analysis, and sometimes using catchy phrases as substitute for serious
  argument.'
