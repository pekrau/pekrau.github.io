abstract: The field of evolutionary psychology has often been the target of allegations
  that its hypotheses are unfalsifiable. This article revisits this decades-old critique
  by examining the logic of falsifiability and the specific criteria required for
  a hypothesis to be considered falsified. We evaluate the multiple levels of analysis
  in the heuristic framework from which evolutionary psychology hypotheses are derived.
  We then present evidence of several evolutionary psychological hypotheses that have
  generated specific, falsifiable predictions; undergone multiple empirical tests;
  and been refuted. Specifically, we discuss the evidentiary status of (a) the ovulatory
  shift in mate preferences (dual-mating) hypothesis, (b) the mate deprivation hypothesis
  of rape, and (c) the kin altruism hypothesis for the evolution of male homosexuality.
  We contrast these with the wide range of evolutionary psychology hypotheses whose
  specific predictions have been robustly supported by empirical data. Notably, studies
  reveal that many academics continue to perceive evolutionary psychology as unfalsifiable,
  despite evidence to the contrary, a misconception that has also permeated mainstream
  culture. These pervasive misconceptions speak to the critical need for ongoing efforts
  to clarify the scientific methodologies and evidentiary standards employed in the
  field of evolutionary psychology. Our discussion addresses implicit beliefs underlying
  allegations of unfalsifiability, such as beliefs about unverifiability, the varying
  levels of quality among hypotheses in the field, and the necessity for enhancing
  conceptual and empirical precision in future research. By illustrating that hypotheses
  generated by evolutionary psychology can be directly tested with appropriate scientific
  rigor, we dispel these pervasive misconceptions and highlight the field&#39;s heuristic
  potential for generating valuable insights into human behavior. (PsycInfo Database
