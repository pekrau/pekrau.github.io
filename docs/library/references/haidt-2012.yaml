authors:
- Haidt, Jonathan
content: 'Thoughtful, intellectually honest, well-argued and in my opinion fairly
  convincing. The message is that liberals and conservatives (in the American sense)
  have different "moral matrices", i.e. value different aspects of human life and
  society differently. In one sentence: liberals are more concerned with care for
  individuals, while conservatives value the social fabric higher. Obviously, the
  argument in the book is more complex than this.


  I have some reservations about the arguments concerning religion. The book''s main
  argument is clearly focused on the situation in the US, but it does have considerable
  relevance to the rest of the world.


  I am myself a liberal, according to the book''s classification. But I have lately
  seen more clearly the points of "the other side", and we are in real need of a discussion.
  Haidt is hopeful that it may be possible. Even if Trump is evidence to the contrary,
  maybe our current epoch may eventually prove Haidt right.'
