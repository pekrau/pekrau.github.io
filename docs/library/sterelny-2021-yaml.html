content: &#34;A short, well-argued book about the prerequisites and possible scenarios\
  \ for the evolution of Homo sapiens, with a focus on special collaborative and cultural\
  \ capabilities of said species. As part of laying out his own arguments and hypotheses,\
  \ Sterelny nicely reviews the currently known facts about the evolution of hominims\
  \ since 7 million years ago, and comments on uncertainties and controversies.\n\n\
  Unfortunately, his text is so condensed that he sometimes just assumes that the\
  \ reader has background knowledge of some examples and debates he mentions. For\
  \ example, he mentions the interesting anthropological case of the conflict between\
  \ the Nuer and Dinka peoples, but does not explain the background. This makes the\
  \ text unsuitable for newcomers to the field.\n\nFrom this and other texts I have\
  \ read recently, it is clear that the sparseness of hard data points makes it practically\
  \ impossible to produce solid hypotheses about the mechanisms that drove the evolution\
  \ of cooperation and cumulative culture. \n\nDiscussing several controversies in\
  \ this area, Sterelny argues that the effects of group selection may have played\
  \ some role, but that several other recent contributions to the field have oversold\
  \ the case. Sterelny offers a nuanced alternative which builds a case for the evolution\
  \ of cooperation, culture and tribal sociality built mainly on traditional notions\
  \ of individual selection. I believe his arguments are basically valid, although\
  \ not flawless.\n\nOne of his main points is that the mobile hunter/gatherer mode\
  \ of life was one of fundamental equality between people, at least within the sexes.\
  \ It was the gradual shift to farming that created societies with high levels of\
  \ inequality. But importantly, more sedentary hunter/gatherers in the anthropological\
  \ record also show examples of pronounced inequality. Sterelny provides a set of\
  \ scenarios explaining the possible mechanisms of the growth of inequality, which\
  \ in my mind seem eminently plausible.\n\nIn the last section of the book, Sterelny\
  \ concludes that the problem of cooperation and culture is basically one of how\
  \ the initial establishment of cooperation occurred. He thinks that once a basic\
  \ mode of cooperation was achieved, the benefits of it were so great that it becomes\
  \ easier to explain how the positive feedback loops could maintain this cooperation,\
  \ and allow further evolution. Maybe. I am more impressed by the conditionality\
  \ of it all. There were so many things that had to come together to create Homo\
  \ sapiens. Our existence is a stochastic phenomenon.&#34;
