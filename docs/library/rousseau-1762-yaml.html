authors:
- Rousseau, Jean-Jacques
content: Yes, it is a classic. But dare I say it? It isn&#39;t very good. In fact, it
  is rather bad. Rousseau is overrated. His idea about the development of society
  out of a bunch of asocial individuals (not &#34;noble savages&#34;) has been thoroughly
  debunked by evolutionary history. Its use as a hypothetical basis for political
  theory through the vague notion of the &#34;general will&#34; has generated more confusion
  than clarity. And the latter parts of the Social Contract, with their climate-based
  notions of governance, and other weird comments, are just bizarre. No, I do not
  approve.
