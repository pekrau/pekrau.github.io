- Christakis, Nicholas A
content: The author argues that we, the species Homo sapiens, has a &#34;social suite&#34;
  of features, including love, friendship, sociality, mild hierarchy, cooperation
  and social learning, based on our genetic legacy. The message is that all humans
  share these important properties, and that this universal heritage should be given
  more focus. The problem is that this positive view of humanity doesn&#39;t explain why
  we are also prone to forming oppressive societies and cultures, and why we wage
  war. Indeed, the author acknowledges, in the last few pages of the book, that his
  description has a &#34;sociodicy&#34; problem, analogous to the theodicy problem of religions
  that posit a benevolent god who somehow allows evil in the world. Christakis does
  not resolve the problem. But the book has many qualities, giving good summaries
  of much recent scientific work in a number of fields. It is a good read. I plan
  to write about the book elsewhere, so I will not to into more detail here.
