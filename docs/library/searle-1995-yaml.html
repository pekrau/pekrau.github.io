authors:
- Searle, John Rogers
content: The analysis is pretty clear, although quite dry and abstract. The book does
  not spell out very well what consequences its line of argument has in current discussions.
  It seems to me that a wider discussion in terms of the evolution of humans and their
  society would be useful. The discussion about &#34;external realism&#34; show how absurd
  various kinds of anti-realism are, and also gives some explanation of why these
  absurd positions still are fairly popular.
