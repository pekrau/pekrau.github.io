content: &#39;This is an anthology. It is, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. That said, the
  various contributions do make up a fairly diverse and well-presented set of viewpoints.
  What does the idea of human nature mean? What is it supposed to do? Is it meaningful
  in light of the combined influence of nature and culture on human existence?


  Tim Lewens writes a nice introduction to both the debate in general, and the contributions
  in this volume.


  Edouard Machery defends his nomological account of human nature: It characterizes
  human nature as a set of traits that human beings tend to possess as a result of
  the evolution of their species. The traits need not be distinctive of humans, nor
  need they be shared by all humans; they merely need to be typical. I have some sympathy
  with this view, but there are problems, for instance with the trait of sex: is being
  male of female typical? Clearly that trait, having two possible values (yes, that
  is another debate) should be included, but it appears that the nomological account
  does not do that.


  Grant Ramsey offers an alternative in the shape of a trait bin and trait cluster
  account. Here, traits come in a limited set of possible combinations, that may vary
  over a human being&#39;&#39;s life. It can therefore handle the development of a human being.
  This approach also seems able to handle the influence of culture, broadly construed,
  over a human being&#39;&#39;s life. My own views are closest to this account, although I
  would present it differently.


  Karola Stots and Paul Griffiths emphasises the developmental trajectory of a human
  being, and how various influences overtime mould the human being. They argue that
  human nature is not embodied in one input to development, such as the genome. Organisms
  are fundamentally processes, they say, and therefore a developmental systems account
  is most appropriate. I sympathize, but I am not entirely clear what it means in
  concrete terms.


  Cecilia Heyes thinks the idea of human nature should be patched up rather than eliminated.
  She discusses the idea of natural pedagogy as a concrete example of how one could
  discuss one facet of human nature. Natural pedagogy proposes that human infants
  genetically inherit a well-organised package of biases, tendencies and skills making
  them receptive to deliberate attempts by adults to convey information. She analyses
  the evidence for the genetic basis and finds it to be weak. She suggests that a
  hybrid of the nomological view and what she refers to as &#34;evolutionary causal essentialism&#34;
  might be fruitful. She thinks &#34;Mother Culture&#34; does a lot of the hard work in preparing
  children to be taught. I am not fully convinced by her arguments, but they require
  some serious thought.


  John Dupré wants to view humans as processes. He says that seeing human behaviour
  as a uniquely developed capacity for flexible response to the environment makes
  it unsurprising that it is difficult to provide a definite account of human behaviour.
  Even though he says that humans are neither blank slates, nor machines with a predetermined
  programme, he ends up saying that since the notion of human nature is commonly associated
  with a set of fixed properties, it is safest to dispense with its use altogether.
  I find this conclusion fundamentally dissatisfying. If humans have a uniquely developed
  capacity for flexible responses, then that is part of human nature.


  Kim Sterelny says that a kind of field guide description of humans is possible,
  but that that would not be the same as a theory of human nature. He thinks the idea
  of an evolutionary &#34;key innovation&#34; that set humans apart from their immediate ancestors
  is mistaken. Human evolution is based on positive feedback between multiple factors
  and capabilities. The idea of human nature masks this complicated evolutionary history.
  Sterelny&#39;&#39;s discussion is multifaceted and highly interesting and goes on to culture
  and cooperation as essential parts of the story. But as for the other human-nature-skeptical
  essays, I am not convinced that it shows that there is no place for an empirical
  description of human nature.


  Kevin Laland and Gillian Brown are on the war path against the idea of a human nature,
  and demolish three different conceptions of it. Either they are untenable, or they
  do not do any real work. They emphasize the plastic nature of human development.
  They concede that certain aspects of behavioural development exhibit consistency
  and stability over space and time, but their focus is on plasticity and gene-culture
  coevolution. At the end of the day, their argument seems to boil down to the statement
  that the idea of human nature is somehow dangerous. My point: that does not invalidate
  it.


  Peter Richerson thinks that whether one is for or against the idea of human nature
  is correlated with how strongly one commits to the tenets of the Modern Synthesis.
  He argues as if the coevolution of genes and culture is forbidden by, or at least
  not handled by the Modern Synthesis. I do not see that he makes that case. He discusses
  the ideas of a number of thinkers in brief sketches, and makes the case that the
  gene-culture coevolution idea is an alternative to human nature. I appreciated the
  many insights that his text contains, but I am not fully convinced. I do not quite
  see why accepting the fundamental influence of culture on human evolution in and
  by itself invalidates the idea of a human nature.


  Christina Toren attempts to provide an anthropological point of view. Unfortunately,
  this text evinces excruciating verbiage. That is, it excels in using many difficult
  words and convoluted sentences. I find it hard to distil anything of interest out
  of it. The main point seems to be that one should study human ontogeny as a microhistorical
  process. Ok? She says we need a unified model of human being. The distinction between
  nature and culture must go. At the end, she displays her woke credentials in a garbled
  sentence that says: &#34;It seems obvious to me that an acknowledgement that ontogeny
  is through and through a historical process would put paid to ideas of &#39;&#39;culture&#39;&#39;
  and &#39;&#39;human nature&#39;&#39; and, in so doing, provide for a proper understanding of how
  certainly we condemn future generations to a deepening of the inequalities and injustices
  that we are failing to address.&#34; I find the latter part incomprehensible. It reads
  as if her proposal would deepen inequalities, which is obviously not her intent.
  But what have inequalities do to with any of this, anyway?


  Maria Kronenfeldner describes seven reasons why there is disagreement about human
  nature. She points out that nature and culture are almost always used in a dualistic,
  antithetical pair, but that reference to nature has usually been done as a move
  to impose a certain kind of authoritative understanding. She reviews the use of
  the concept of nature from the Greeks via the Enlightenment and the early days of
  Darwinism with Francis Galton as a central figure. She goes on to the development
  of cultural anthropology by Alfred Kroeber. She concludes that the former essentialist
  idea of nature has been replaced by three scientific concepts: a classificatory,
  a descriptive, and an explanatory nature. This is an interesting historical review.
  Its goal is not to propose a particular view of human nature.


  And there concludes the book.&#39;
