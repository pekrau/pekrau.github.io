authors:
- Haidt, Jonathan
content: &#39;Thoughtful, intellectually honest, well-argued and in my opinion fairly
  convincing. The message is that liberals and conservatives (in the American sense)
  have different &#34;moral matrices&#34;, i.e. value different aspects of human life and
  society differently. In one sentence: liberals are more concerned with care for
  individuals, while conservatives value the social fabric higher. Obviously, the
  argument in the book is more complex than this.


  I have some reservations about the arguments concerning religion. The book&#39;&#39;s main
  argument is clearly focused on the situation in the US, but it does have considerable
  relevance to the rest of the world.


  I am myself a liberal, according to the book&#39;&#39;s classification. But I have lately
  seen more clearly the points of &#34;the other side&#34;, and we are in real need of a discussion.
  Haidt is hopeful that it may be possible. Even if Trump is evidence to the contrary,
  maybe our current epoch may eventually prove Haidt right.&#39;
