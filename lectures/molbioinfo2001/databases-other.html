<P>
GeneCards is a database of human genes, their products and their
involvement in diseases. It offers concise information about the
functions of all human genes that have an approved symbol, as well as
selected others. It is a typical example of a
<STRONG>secondary</STRONG> database, which contains many links to
other databases, and attempts to consolidate the information that is
available for a specific class of entity, in this case human genes.

The web site can be used for free by academics, but companies must
obtain a license.

<H3>KEGG

<P>
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is an effort to
computerize current knowledge of molecular and cellular biology in
terms of the information pathways that consist of interacting
molecules or genes and to provide links from the gene catalogs
produced by genome sequencing projects.
</P>

<P>
Although there seems to be no explicit license information, it appears 
that the web site can be used by anyone (including
companies). However, downloading of the KEGG distribution requires a
license agreement for non-academic users.
