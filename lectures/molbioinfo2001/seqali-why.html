<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Sequence alignment: why?</H1>

<P>
Early in the days of protein and gene sequence analysis, it was
discovered that the sequences from related proteins or genes were
similar, in the sense that one could align the sequences so that many
corresponding residues match. This discovery was very important, since
strong similarity between two genes is a strong argument for their
homology. Bioinformatics is based on it.
<P>
</P>
A note on terminology: <STRONG>Homology</STRONG> means that two (or
more) sequences have a common ancestor. This is a statement about
evolutionary history. <STRONG>Similarity</STRONG> simply means that
two sequences are similar, by some criterion. It does not refer to any
historical process, just to a comparison of the sequences by some
method. It is a logically weaker statement. However, in bioinformatics
these two terms are often confused and used interchangeably. The
reason is probably that significant similarity is such a strong
argument for homology.

Here is an example of a sequence
alignment for two proteins (the protein kinase KRAF_HUMAN and the
uncharacterized O22558 from Arabidopsis thaliana, from SWISSPROT)
using the BLAST program.

The basis for comparison of proteins and genes using the similarity of
their sequences is that the <STRONG>the proteins or genes are related
by evolution</STRONG>; they have a common ancestor. Random mutations
in the sequences accumulate over time, so that proteins or genes that 
have a common ancestor far back in time are not as similar as proteins
or genes that diverged from each other more recently. Analysis of
evolutionary relationships between protein or gene sequences depends
critically on sequence alignments.
</P>

<P>
There are many features of sequence alignments that give interesting
information. For example, a closer analysis of the alignment can
reveal which parts of the sequences that are likely to be important
for the function, if the proteins are involved in similar
processes. In parts of the sequence of a protein which are not very
critical for its function, the random mutations can accumulate more
easily. In parts of the sequence that are critical for the function of
the protein, hardly any mutations will be accepted; nearly all changes
in such regions will destroy the function.
</P>

<P>
Sequence alignment has become an essential part of biological
science. There are now many different techniques and implementations
of methods to perform alignment of sequences.
</P>

<P>
The <STRONG>dotplot</STRONG> is a simple, graphical way of displaying
sequence similarity. One can use it to easily spot segments of good
sequence similarity. The two sequences are placed on each side of
2-dimensional matrix, and each cell in the matrix is then filled with 
a value for how well a short window of the sequences match at that
point.
