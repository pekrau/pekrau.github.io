<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Accession codes vs identifiers</H1>

<P>
Many databases in bioinformatics (SWISS-PROT, EMBL, GenBank, Pfam) use
a system where an entry can be identified in two different ways;
essentially it has two names: 

<UL>
<LI> Identifier
<LI> Accession code (or number)
</UL>
</P>

<P>
The question how to deal with changed, updated and deleted entries in
databases is a very tricky problem, and the policies for how accession
codes and identifiers are changed or kept constant are not completely
consistent between databases or even over time for one single
database.
</P>
<P>
The exact definition of what the identifier and accession code are
supposed to denote varies between the different databases, but the
basic idea is the following:
</P>

<H3>Identifier</H3>
<P>
An <STRONG>identifier</STRONG> ("locus" in GenBank, "entry name" in
SWISS-PROT) is a string of letters and digits that generally is
interpretable in some meaningful way by a human, for instance as a
recognizable abbreviation of the full protein or gene name.
</P>

<P>
SWISS-PROT uses a system where the entry name consists
of two parts: the first denotes the protein and the second part
denotes the species it is found in. For example,
<STRONG>KRAF_HUMAN</STRONG> is the entry name for the Raf-1 oncogene
from Homo sapiens.
</P>

<P>
An identifier <STRONG>can change</STRONG>. For example, the database
curators may decide that the identifier for an entry no longer is
appropriate. This does not happen very often.
</P>

<H3>Accession code (number)</H3>
<P>
An <STRONG>accession code</STRONG> (or number) is a number (possibly
with a few characters in front) that uniquely identifies an entry. For
example, the accession code for <STRONG>KRAF_HUMAN</STRONG> in
SWISS-PROT is <STRONG>P04049</STRONG>.
</P>
<P>
The main conceptual difference from the identifier is that it is
supposed to be stable: any given accession code will, as soon as it
has been issued, always refer to that entry, or its ancestors. It is
often called the <STRONG>primary key</STRONG> for the entry. The
accession code, once issued, must always be possible to find again, 
even after large changes have been made to the entry.
</P>
<P>
In the case where <STRONG>two entries are merged into one
single</STRONG>, then the new entry will have <STRONG>both accession
codes</STRONG>, where one will be the <STRONG>primary</STRONG> and the
other the <STRONG>secondary</STRONG> accession code. When an entry is
<STRONG>split into two</STRONG>, both new entries will get new
accession codes, but will also have the old accession code as
secondary codes.
