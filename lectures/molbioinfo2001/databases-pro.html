<P>
The two protein sequence databases SWISS-PROT and PIR are different
from the nucleotide databases in that they are both
<STRONG>curated</STRONG>. This means that groups of designated
curators (scientists) prepare the entries from literature and/or
contacts with external experts.
</P>

<H3>SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL
<A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/">www.expasy.ch/sprot/</A>
</H3>

<P>
SWISS-PROT is a protein sequence database which strives to provide a
<STRONG>high level of annotations</STRONG> (such as the description of
the  function of a protein, its domains structure, post-translational
modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high
level of integration with other databases.
</P>

<P>
It was started in 1986 by Amos Bairoch in the Department of Medical
Biochemistry at the University of Geneva. This database is generally
considered one of the best protein sequence databases in terms of the
quality of the annotation. Release 39.12 (11 Jan 2001) contained
92,211 entries. 
</P>

<P>
TrEMBL is a <STRONG>computer-annotated supplement</STRONG> of
SWISS-PROT that contains all the translations of EMBL nucleotide
sequence entries not yet integrated in SWISS-PROT. The procedure that
is used to produce it was developed by Rolf Apweiler. Release 15.14
(5 Jan 2001) contained 378,152 entries. The annotation of an entry in
TrEMBL has not (yet) reached the standards required for inclusion into
SWISS-PROT proper.
</P>

<P>
SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL are developed by the SWISS-PROT groups at 
<A HREF="http://www.isb-sib.ch/">Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics
(SIB)</A> and at <A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">EBI</A>.
The databases can be accesses and searched through the 
<A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/srs5/">the SRS system at ExPASy</A>, or
one can download the entire database as one single flat file. An
example of what an entry looks like is given for the 
<A HREF="kraf_human.sprot">human raf oncogene protein, ID
KRAF_HUMAN</A>.
</P>

<P>
The SWISS-PROT database has <STRONG>some legal restrictions</STRONG>:
the entries themselves are copyrighted, but freely accessible and
usable by academic researchers. Commercial companies must pay a
license fee from SIB to use SWISS-PROT.
</P>

<H3>PIR
<A HREF="http://pir.georgetown.edu/">pir.georgetown.edu</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Protein Information Resource (PIR) is a division of the National
Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) in the US. It is involved in a
collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://mips.gsf.de/">Munich Information Center
for Protein Sequences (MIPS)</A> and the Japanese International
Protein Sequence Database (JIPID). Release 67.00 (31 Dec 2000)
contains 198,801 entries.
</P>

<P>
PIR grew out of Margaret Dayhoff's work in the middle of the 1960s. It
strives to be <STRONG>comprehensive</STRONG>, well-organized,
accurate, and consistently annotated. However, it is generally
believed that it does not reach the level of completeness in the entry
annotation as does SWISS-PROT. Although SWISS-PROT and PIR overlap 
extensively, there are still many sequences which can be found in only
one of them.
</P>

<P>
One can search for entries or do sequence similarity searches at the
PIR site. The database can also be downloaded as a set of files. An
example of what an entry looks like is given for the 
<A HREF="tvhuf6.pir">human raf-1 oncogene protein, ID TVHUF6</A>.
</P>

<P>
PIR also produces the <STRONG>NRL-3D</STRONG>, which is a database of
sequences extracted from the three-dimensional structures in
<A HREF="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">the Protein Databank (PDB)</A> (see
also <A HREF="databases-3d.html">the following page in this
lecture</A>. The NRL_3D database makes the sequence information in
PDB available for similarity searches and retrieval and provides
cross-reference information for use with the other PIR Protein
Sequence Databases.
