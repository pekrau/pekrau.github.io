Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing
random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.

<H3>Pseudo RNG</H3>

<P>
An RNG is an algorithm that produces series of random numbers.
The series is not really random: pseudo. The algorithm is
deterministic; the same input will always generate the same output.
</P>

<H3>Seed</H3>

<P>
The input can be varied: the seed. Different seeds should ideally
generate totally uncorrelated series. One may choose a seed manually,
or use the current time, or some other variable value.
</P>

<H3>Output interval</H3>

<P>
Uniform RNGs: within a range [0, MAXINT] every value has the same
probability of being produced next.
</P>
<P>
Integers <I>vs</I> real numbers (continuous). Open or closed intervals:
<UL>
<LI> [0.0, 1.0] The edge values may appear in the series.
<LI> (0.0, 1.0] 0.0 will not appear, but any arbitrarily small number may.
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Period (cycle)</H3>

<P>
An RNG has a period (cycle). After some (hopefully large) M number of
random numbers have been produced, the RNG will loop back to where the
series started.
</P>
<P>
The current consensus is that any simulation should use only a small
fraction (< 1%) of the values available in the period for an RNG. So
the period should be very large.
</P>

<H3>Randomness; quality</H3>

<P>
How characterize? How measure quality, or test? Look out for
pathological cases, subtle correlations, non-uniform
distributions. Many theoretical and numerical tests available, but
none can ever prove that an RNG is perfect.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: Low-order bits are often bad. Do not use.
</P>
<P>
Basic message: some RNGs are known to be bad, others have passes
many tests successfully. No proof, though. Use several different RNGs
for solving your problem when the result depends critically on the RNG
quality, as they sometimes do in simulations of various natural
processes.
