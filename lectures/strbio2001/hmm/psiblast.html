PSI-BLAST
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9254694&dopt=Abstract">Altschul
et al 1997</A>) is a program for searching for homologs of a probe
sequence (protein, usually) that uses a profile strategy to achieve
high sensitivity. It stands for Position-Specific Iterated BLAST.
</P>

<P>
The basic strategy underlying PSI-BLAST is that starting from the probe
sequence, an ordinary search of the database is performed. The hits
that are found are then used to set up a sequence profile, which is
then used again to search for similar sequences. The idea is that
instead of having to build a profile (HMM or other) oneself, the
program does it automatically from the single sequence one gives it.
</P>

<P>
The PSI-BLAST program is much more sensitive than the BLAST program,
but it takes more CPU time. It competes to a certain extent with the
HMM-based approaches.
<P>
</P>
It has some important drawbacks: If the probe sequence contains a
strongly conserved domain, then the profile may be weighted towards it
and away from the rest of the sequence as the iterations are
performed. There is a danger that one misses weak homologies for other
parts in the sequence than the strongly conserved domain. Of course,
this may happen with other methods as well.
</P>

<P>
A particular problem is posed by the so-called low-complexity regions
in proteins (typically Gln, Ser, Thr and Pro-rich regions): these
regions should be masked out, or the search will likely just try to
pick up other proteins that contain this kind of sequence, which is
almost certainly not what one wants.
