<P>
The protein <STRONG>Ras p21</STRONG> (also called cH-ras p21) was
discovered in the early 1980's as <STRONG>an oncogene</STRONG>, i.e. a
gene that was mutated in many tumours, and which presumably must be
involved in making cells become cancerous, or keeping them in a
cancerous state. An immense amount of research has gone into
characterization of these oncogenes, and one large group of them have
turned out to be genes that participate in the regulation of cell
growth and division.
</P>

<P>
In the beginning of the 1990's, the growth regulation pathway which
Ras p21 is a central part of was unravelled. It turns out that
<STRONG>Ras p21 is part of a signalling cascade</STRONG> that also
contains the proteins Shc, Grb2, SOS, GAP, Raf-1, MEK, ERK, and
others. The purpose of the cascade is to transduce a signal from a
growth-factor receptor in the cell membrane (there are several
different ones) to the transcriptional regulation of genes in the
nucleus that control cellular growth and division.
</P>

<P>
In the image below (from the
<A HREF="http://www.grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp/spad/index.html">SPAD</A>
database), the receptor is the EGF receptor, which is a kinase that
autophosphorylates itself upon binding of the EGF hormone. The
Grb2 protein then binds the phosphorylated EGF receptor. This complex
binds to SOS, which is activated to perform nucleotide exchange of Ras
p21, so that it binds GTP instead of GDP, thus being activated. Raf-1
binds to the activated Ras p21, and becomes an active kinase which
turns on a phosphorylation cascade involving MEK and MEKK-1. One of
the mechanisms that turns off the signal is the GAP protein that can
bind the GTP form of Ras p21, and makes it hydrolyze its GTP into GDP,
thus becoming inactive again.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>One way that this regulatory network can break down is if one
of the switches becomes stuck in the 'on' position</STRONG>. This is
what happens when certain important mutations of the Ras p21 gene
occur. In a few Ras p21 mutants, the protein becomes unable to
hydrolyze GTP, and so will always be in the active state.
</P>

<P>
<STRONG>The Ras p21 network is strongly conserved among
species</STRONG>. It can be found in the fruit fly, nematode, yeast,
and mammals, and the component proteins share significant sequence
similarities, and have the same molecular functions in the
pathway. However, the exact process that employs the pathway varies
considerably. In fact, this is also the case within one organism. The
Ras p21 pathway can be involved in different processes in different
cell types, and may also give different results depending on the
nature of the original signal. This means that the Ras p21 pathway is
to a certain extent non-specific: it usually implies cellular growth,
but the exact nature of that cellular growth is dependent on other
factors.
