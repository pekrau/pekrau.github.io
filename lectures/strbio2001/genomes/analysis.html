<P>
So, what does one do with a complete genome? After all, a sequenced
genome consists only of so many bases in a defined order. Analysis is
obviously necessary in order to obtain biologically interesting
information. 
</P>

<P>
The analysis of a genome covers many different aspects. Here follows a
list of the most common ones, but it is clear that entirely novel ways
of analysing a complete genome can be invented. The potential for
interesting discoveries in the complete genomes is great; we have
probably just scratched the surface so far.

<UL>

<LI> Define the location of genes (coding sequences, regulatory
regions): gene prediction (identification).
  <UL>
  <LI> Gene prediction <I>ab initio</I> using software based on rules
  and patterns. Find Open Reading Frames (ORFs), with some additional
  criteria. Fairly simple for bacteria, very difficult for eukaryotes.
  <LI> Gene identification through alignment with know proteins and
  EST sequences.
  <LI> Gene prediction through similarity with proteins or ESTs in
  other organisms.
  <LI> Gene prediction through comparison with other genomes;
  conserved regions may be coding or regulatory regions. Synteny.
  </UL>
<P>
<LI> Annotation of the genes: Identify with known genes, similarity
with genes in other organisms. Essentially: labelling the gene.
<P>
<LI> Functional classification. Broad groups of functional
characterization, such as 'ribosomal proteins', 'nucleotide
metabolism', 'signal transduction'.
<P>
<LI> Metabolic pathways.
  <UL>
  <LI> Are any common pathways missing?
  <LI> Are there 'gaps' (missing enzymes) in some pathways?
  <LI> Compare identified pathways with the life style of the
  organism.
  </UL>
<P>
<LI> Evolutionary history
  <UL>
  <LI> Internal genome duplications can sometimes be detected.
  <LI> Gene decay can sometimes be characterized: genes that are on
  their 'way out' after duplication, or because the life style of the
  organism has changed.
