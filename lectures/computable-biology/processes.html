The emphasis in bioinformatics has so far been on structures, in a
wide sense of the word; (comparatively) easy to represent, store, analyse.
<UL>
<LI> The genomes
<LI> Protein 3D structure/function
<LI> Transcriptome, proteome, metabolome
<LI> Pathways (wiring diagrams)
</UL>

But:
</P>

<H1 align=center>Biology = structures + processes</H1>

<P>
Biology deals with processes, but, so far, bioinformatics has not been
able to formalize and handle biological processes nearly as
successfully as biological structures.
</P>

<P>
To make biology computable, there is a need for a formalization of
biological processes. Databases will be requried where the data models
contain time is a fundamental coordinate.
</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> The microarray time-series experiments contain both complete
structural data, as well as temporal data.
<LI> The 'Gene Ontology' project contains a Biological Process
concept, albeit without any description of the dynamics.
<LI> Systems Biology, simulation engines: temporal data will be
required as constraints and tests.
<LI> The various pathways and interactions databases rarely have the
concept of time.
<LI> Specialised databases in developmental biology (mouse, C elegans)
contains some temporal data.
