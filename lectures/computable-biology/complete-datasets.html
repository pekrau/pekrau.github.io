<P>
The success of the projects to determine the complete genomes has
created a strong momentum in the quest for obtaining other 'complete'
molecular datasets in biology.

<TD>
The complete set and levels of proteins in a cell or
tissue, including modifications, complexes.
</TD>
<TD>
Not routine.
<BR>
2D-gels with mass spectrometry. GFP fusions. Y2H. Quantification very
difficult. Completeness difficult.

<TH>Metabolome</TH>
<TD>
All metabolites and their concentrations. Defined as
organic small molecules, not protein, RNA or DNA.
</TD>
<TD>
Not routine.
<BR>
NMR, MS, specific methods. Quantification and resolution
difficult. Completeness may be reachable.
