<UL>
<LI> Based on the key/value data abstraction:
  <UL>
  <LI> The value is the data item to be stored.
  <LI> The key is the search key for the data item (the value).
  </UL>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Random access; any data item can be accessed in constant time.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> The data to be handled should be simple, but not necessarily homogenous.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> A DBM database is essentially a hash table that is stored on
disk.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> A hash table is basically an array that is indexed by strings.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> In principle, the data item (value) can be any string of bytes.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> In practice, an implementation can often only handle strings, and
sometimes of limited sizes.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Implementations: DBM (original, obsolete), GDBM (current),
Berkeley DB.
