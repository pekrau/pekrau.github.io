<P>
RDBMS are almost always designed as client/server systems:
</P>

<UL>
<LI> The server is the process that does the hard work
  <UL>
  <LI> Reads and writes the physical files containing the data.
  <LI> Checks that a user may login, and checks privileges.
  <LI> Handles inserts, updates, deletes.
  <LI> Performs the selects, applies all possible optimizations.
  <LI> Communicates with the clients: receives queries, returns results.
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI> The client is a process that issues the commands to do inserts,
  updates, deletes, selects.
  <UL>
  <LI> The client uses the database through a connection to the
  server.
  <LI> It never accesses the data directly.
  <LI> The client may execute on the same machine, or connect via the
  net from some other machine.
  <LI> The client may be a GUI, a command-line interface, or some
  process doing calculations.
  <LI> Most RDBMS has a ready-made shell-like client allowing a user
  to work interactively with a database using SQL commands.
  <LI> Programs can become clients by using APIs (Application
  Programming Interfaces) in the code to access the data.
  <LI> Interfaces exist for C, C++, Perl, Python for most RDBMS systems.
