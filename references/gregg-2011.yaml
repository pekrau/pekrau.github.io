- Gregg, Benjamin
content: I am sympathetic to the general thesis of the book, that human rights should
  be understood as social constructs, and not as predefined concepts handed down by
  theology or by some definition of humanity. But the book is disappointing nonetheless.
  The writing is heavy and rather disorganized, the final proposed idea of a "human
  rights state" is not clearly defined or described. I wish a ruthless editor had
  taken charge, there is a good text somewhere within this book.
