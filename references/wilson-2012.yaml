authors:
- Wilson, Edward O
content: 'A very interesting read, to be recommended to anyone interested in the interaction
  of culture, sociality and biology. Homo sapiens is an intensely social animal, and
  this can only be explained by group selection based on a number of preselected traits
  of the predecessors, according to Wilson. Culture is the layered on top of this,
  in its turn affecting evolution and therefore also the genetics of humans, making
  us unique.


  Wilson contends that the previously accepted theory of kin selection cannot explain
  the evolution of sociality in general. In the case of Homo sapiens and its predecessors,
  multi-level selection involving group selection must be invoked. In my mind the
  author makes his case convincingly.


  The book could have used a tougher editor. It contains some redundant reiteration
  of arguments and positions. The writing is good and to the point. References are
  relegated to a section at the back, relieving the text from footnotes and numbered
  references.'
