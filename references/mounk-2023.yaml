content: "A clear and illuminating analysis of what the author Yascha Mounk calls\
  \ the \"identity synthesis\", which the author describes as a set of ideas encompassing\
  \ several themes: A radical skepticism concerning the possibility of rational discourse\
  \ and the search for objective truth, the impossibility of the universalist stance\
  \ against racism and oppression, and radical politics strangely combined with a\
  \ pessimism about the possibility of political reform. Mounk thinks the terms \"\
  identity politics\", \"critical race theory\" and \"woke\" have been so thoroughly\
  \ laden with rhetorical baggage that he wants to stay away from them, and therefore\
  \ uses \"identity synthesis\" instead.\n\nThe analysis is very well structured,\
  \ and traces the evolution of these ideas from Michel Foucault, Edward Said, Gayatri\
  \ Chakravorty Spivak, Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, and others,\
  \ to the more recent texts from Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X Kendi. The earlier influences\
  \ from Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt are not included in this analysis. Intriguingly,\
  \ Mounk proposes that a lot of what is now known as \"woke\" standpoints and phraseology\
  \ was born in discussions on the social media site Tumblr, rather than on Facebook\
  \ or Twitter.\n\nMounk's criticism of the \"identity synthesis\" is that it becomes\
  \ a trap, since by rejecting universalism and the ideal of a society that has moved\
  \ beyond racial categories, the supposed radical stance actually becomes regressive.\
  \ For instance, so-called standpoint theory facilitates tribalism, it is not an\
  \ antidote.\n\nThe book concludes with a kind of manual: \"How to escape the identity\
  \ trap\". It posits three possible scenarios for how the identity synthesis might\
  \ fare in the public debate: First, that it is too late to escape the identity trap.\
  \ We are condemned to tribalistic fights for group-based privileges and woke purges\
  \ of so-called \"violence\", i.e. disagreement. The second scenario is that there\
  \ will be increasing push-back against moral panics and performative acts, which\
  \ will discourage the \"woke\" movement into retreat. The third scenario is that\
  \ some, but not all, of the concepts and ideas of the identity synthesis will become\
  \ entrenched in the general debate, and cause continued clashes for many years to\
  \ come. This is what Mounk believes will happen, unless a principled stance against\
  \ the identity synthesis can grow strong.\n\nSo what to do? Mounk says that the\
  \ reason he wrote the book was to help ordinary people point out the dangers of\
  \ the identity trap, as a way to counteract its most dangerous effects. He gives\
  \ some advice: do not apologize for believing in the universalist position, do not\
  \ vilify those who disagree, remember that some who agree with some of your arguments\
  \ may disagree with others (and that is fine), and finally, do not become a reactionary\
  \ just to be in opposition to the identity synthesis.\n\n The analysis, criticism\
  \ and description of the liberal alternative are very clearly stated, and the text\
  \ can be used a a handbook. However, even if the author is clearly very engaged\
  \ in the issue, the text does have a tone of a university lecture. Somehow, it is\
  \ a bit too restrained."
