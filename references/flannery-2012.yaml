content: 'How did inequality arise? The question was famously raised by Jean-Jacques
  Rousseau. His answer was controversial, to say the least. He did not have much information
  to base his analysis on, given that the discovery of humanity being a product of
  Darwinian evolution was yet to be made. Although there was some information about
  how hunter-gatherers lived in parts of the world that were being colonized by European
  traders and settlers, it was fragmentary at best. The book "The Creation of Inequality"
  by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus does the hard work of summarizing the anthropological
  and archaeological record to identify the stages and processes that transformed
  human society from the large degree of equality that characterized nomadic hunter-gatherers
  (ignoring gender inequality) before about 12,000 years ago. It is a monumental effort,
  and the results give them the basis to provide some more facts-based answers to
  Rousseau''s question.


  Flannery and Marcus present short histories of a large number of societies based
  on their reading of the available evidence. The focus is to identify markers that
  give information about the level and type of inequality, political and social changes,
  and the growth and decay of the societies. The examples range from the Pacific archipelagos,
  the Central American jungles, the plains of Sumer, to the different Indian societies
  on North America and more. It is a fascinating account of the diversity of human
  societies, but there are also many recurring patterns. Flannery and Marcus analyze
  these patterns in terms of changes of the social logic as a result of the interactions
  between the natural, political, and spiritual environment with the inventions that
  were needed to solve day-to-day problems. Several different societies went through
  changes and stages that display many similarities, despite being far separated from
  each other in time and space, and having no knowledge of each other. Independent
  processes displaying similarities are good indicators that there must be some underlying
  common propensities.


  A theme that becomes clear is that one important step providing a foundation for
  inequality was the formation of more or less permanent settlements. These did not
  have to be based on agriculture; there are examples of hunter-gatherers that lived
  in environments with sufficient resources for people to get by without having to
  move around. This allowed the creation and accumulation private property. Another
  theme is the forming of achievement-based hierarchies: Persons (men, usually) who
  were successful gained prestige and could become chiefs, while less successful persons
  became commoners or even slaves. However, the chiefs could not automatically pass
  on their status to their children. That would require further social inventions.


  The account is complex and wide-ranging. Each society or region is dealt with in
  separate chapters. One important point is the difference between hereditary inequality
  in its various shapes, and achievement-based inequality. One point they make is
  that hereditary inequality can be inferred when the graves of children contain items
  of luxury and symbols of power; since they could not have achieved this themselves,
  it indicates that their status depends on inheritance. The historical record shows
  that the move from achievement-based inequality to hereditary inequality is not
  inevitable. However, the social logic works strongly in this direction given certain
  environmental conditions. Formation of large-scale states are most often the result
  of competition between neighboring chiefdoms.


  I cannot vouch for the accuracy of their historical accounts. But the general approach
  seems sensible, and they do point out when they regard the available data to be
  insufficient for conclusions to be drawn. I do not get the impression that the authors
  are trying to push an agenda through tendentious reporting. The book is rather long
  since the authors cover many different societies, and at times it is hard to keep
  up with the wealth of details. However, it is hard to see how it could have been
  done differently without losing the concreteness that is the unique point of their
  approach.


  A question is posed in the final chapter: How can our current societies be made
  more egalitarian? One response is: Put hunter-gatherers in charge. It is a provoking
  thought. Exactly how this could be achieved is left unspecified. The authors do
  not discuss our current Western societies in any depth. They are based on meritocracy,
  rather than aristocracy and monarchy, at least notionally. This means that modern
  societies have an ideological basis that implies greater political equality than
  in the preceding historical era. But at the same time material inequality has increased.
  How do we analyse the social logic that has produced this state of affairs, and
  how do we want to change it? This book provides much food for thought about these
  vital issues.'
