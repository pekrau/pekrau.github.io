authors:
- Ridley, Matt
content: A book on the Nature vs Nurture controversy that has stood the test of time.
  Its message - that genes act via environment and environment via genes in order
  to shape the organism - is as relevant now as it was when the book was first published
  in 2003, although a couple of the recent examples have been complicated by later
  research, I believe. But the basic argument of the book is as sound as ever. A good
  read which I can recommend.
