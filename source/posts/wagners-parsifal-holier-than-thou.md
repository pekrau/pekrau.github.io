Attending the opera [Parsifal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsifal) by [Richard Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner) [at the Royal Opera in Stockholm](http://www.operan.se/parsifal/) on Monday March 28th 2016 was a joy. The singers, the orchestra, the cast and the staging were all wonderful.

However. There was a problem: The libretto. The story. The text.

To show what I mean, I have here collected all instances in [the libretto in English](http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libwagpar_e.htm) where the words "holy" and "sacred" (German: "heilig") have been used to characterize something. The German libretto would yield essentially the same result.



**Act 1**

1. ... the sacred lake
2. Are not beasts sacred here?
3. Whether you are sacred.
4. ... holy Spear!
5. ... unholiest hand!
6. ... holy Spear
7. ... holy faith
8. ... holy noble goblet
9. ... the sacred relic.
10. ... he wished to atone, even become holy.
11. A holy vision
12. ... the holy forest
13. ... the holy Meal
14. ... the Holy of Holies
15. ... the holy relic
16. ... holiest blood
17. ... the sacred Cup
18. In pity's holy longing
19. ... in holiest office
20. That holy I may die...
21. Blood and Body of the holy gift

**Act 2**

1. Because I once strived for holiness?
2. ... the guardian of the Holies
3. ... the Holy Cup
4. The Holy Blood glows
5. ... the holy weapon

**Act 3**

1. ... the holiest of mornings
2. ... the holy day
3. ... the sacred spring
4. Which holy day this is?
5. ... the holiest of holies
6. ... his holy blood
7. ... this holiest day!
8. ... the holy relic
9. The Grail's holy Spear!
10. ... Holy illustrious miracle!
11. ... his holy office
12. The holy manna...
13. ... holy wars
14. ... the holy warrior
15. The holy spring itself
16. A holy office to perform
17. ... holy dew
18. ... its holy office
19. ... His holy Blood
20. This holy Spear
21. Holy Blood...
22. Highest holy Wonder!
