title: 'Nature Via Nurture: Genes, Experience and What Makes Us Human'
---
A book on the Nature vs Nurture controversy that has stood the test of time. Its message - that genes act via environment and environment via genes in order to shape the organism - is as relevant now as it was when the book was first published in 2003, although a couple of the recent examples have been complicated by later research, I believe. But the basic argument of the book is as sound as ever. A good read which I can recommend.
