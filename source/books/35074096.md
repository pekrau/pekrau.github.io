title: 'Mythos: The Greek Myths Retold (Stephen Fry''s Great Mythology, #1)'
---
A very good read, this retelling of the classical Greek myths. One fascinating aspect is the very different idea of godhood compared to the judeo-christian concept. The Greek gods are real persons (so to speak), and quite capricious and moody. They are like morally deficient variants of Hollywood superheroes; they don't really care all that much about morally good deeds. An interesting similarity is that superheroes aren't interesting unless they have a weak spot, like kryptonite for Superman. In the Greek gods' case, it is the rule that no god can revoke the divine command or curse of another god. Numerous stories revolve around this fundamental constraint.
