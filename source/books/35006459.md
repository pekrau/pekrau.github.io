A must-read for understanding the problems of the current political era. The thesis of the book is that the anywheres (educated, accomplished, high-performance urban liberals) have dominated politics and debate, and that the somewheres (rooted, conservative, less-educated workers) have become disenchanted with the development of society and are resentful that their views have been discounted.  This conflict cannot simply be dismissed. Some kind of resolution must be found.
