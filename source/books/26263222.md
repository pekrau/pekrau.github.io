title: Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology
---
As good an exposition of formal ontology has one could possibly get. Clear, methodical, and explicit about the philosophical underpinnings. It lacks a critique of the computational aspects. In my opinion, ontologies are not sufficiently integrated with the web. They are usually available as file dumps for loading into stand-alone software tools, while it seems obvious to me that an ontology should be first and foremost defined as a web service.
