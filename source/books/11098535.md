I have written a comment in Swedish about this book: https://kraulis.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/ian-morris-monstren-i-historiens-utveckling/

Conclusion: A good overview of global history, but its main thesis about the general direction of history is not useful; it does not provide any useful predictions, at any rate.
