title: 'Eugenics: A Very Short Introduction'
---
Very good brief description of eugenics. Main features covered, with attempts at describing influence of eugenics world-wide, not just in Europe and USA. Of course, due to the brevity of this text, some aspects and developments were rather sketchy. The narrative was mainly chronological, but diverged into more thematic discussion, which was occasionally confusing. Nevertheless, I would recommend this booklet.
