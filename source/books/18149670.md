title: Human Rights as Social Construction
---
I am sympathetic to the general thesis of the book, that human rights should be understood as social constructs, and not as predefined concepts handed down by theology or by some definition of humanity. But the book is disappointing nonetheless. The writing is heavy and rather disorganized, the final proposed idea of a "human rights state" is not clearly defined or described. I wish a ruthless editor had taken charge, there is a good text somewhere within this book.
