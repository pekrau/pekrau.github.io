This was a frustrating book. Lots of interesting facts and observations with references, and usually correct (whenever I could judge it). But the text has absolutely no structure at all. It's as if they had lots of short news messages that they copy-pasted together without any overarching story or idea. If you are looking for the occasional fun fact, then maybe it is worth reading. Otherwise not.
