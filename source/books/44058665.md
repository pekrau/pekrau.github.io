title: The New Annotated Frankenstein
---
The classic, in an edition based on the 1818 version, with annotation highlighting changes in the 1831 version. Surprisingly readable. This is one of the few truly iconic stories of the modern Western culture. An essential aspect of Shelley's monster is that he is not evil at the time of creation. It is his abandonment by his creator, Victor Frankenstein, that ignites his fury and makes him thirst for revenge. So is Frankenstein's crime really one of creating the unnatural, or of abandoning his creation?
