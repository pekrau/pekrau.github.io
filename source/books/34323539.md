title: 'The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics'
---
This is a pamphlet urging a rethink of liberal politics. Although it is written almost entirely from the perspective of the US political scene, it does have som relevance to liberals everywhere. Lilla makes the case that today's identity politics  is actually a non-political movement following naturally in the tracks of Reagan's individualist conservative revolution. Liberals need to rediscover proper political action that can have a chance of success at the ballot box. Lilla proposes that the concept of citizenship should be the central organizing principle. However, what concrete policies should be goal of this rethought liberal movement is left unspecified.
