Finally! I've managed to get through this rather tedious and badly organized book. In the process I have become allergic to the phrases "enriched view", "recent scholarship" and "surely it is time to move on", which are repeated ad nauseam.

I intend to write more about the arguments and views of this book elsewhere, suffice it to say that it does not convince. The idea that science is enriched by religion is stated multiple times, but nowhere is any credible example given.

Also, it is rather strange in this day and age to read a book that equates religion with Christianity. As far as I can tell, only hinduism and buddhism are mentioned (both in a derogatory context), and islam not at all. How can this kind of myopia still persist?
