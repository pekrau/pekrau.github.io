Politics is inherent in our form of sociality, and political differences are not aberrations but simply a fact of how we are wired. We have inborn predispositions as to where on the political scale each one of us is located. This scale, the authors contend, is one that goes from the radical stance (pro-change, novelty seeking, interested in others) to the conservative position (pro-tradition, defense of the current state, wary of others). Interestingly, the authors consider the dimension of distributive justice (pro-equality vs pro-meritocratic distribution) to be of lesser importance.<br/><br/>Many different studies are brought to bear on the idea that the differences in political outlook correlate with numerous other traits, ranging from food preferences, attitudes towards strangers, moral foundations, visual attention reactions, and so on. The correlations are in general not particularly strong, but neither are they negligible.<br/><br/>The authors discuss the current political environment of polarisation between the radical and the conservative sides. What they do not adequately account for, in my opinion, is the shift in Western societies from a focus on issues of wealth and distribution towards the so-called culture wars. A scientific analysis that cannot explain the dynamics of the political scene is lacking something. The authors' wish to drive home the innateness of political differences has led to a certain blindness to the fact that cultural and institutional dynamics must also play a strong role. If politics changes, and our genes do no, then something else must account for that change.<br/><br/>But all in all, this is a good read, with many interesting points and useful leads to the current literature.",,,1,0

This has caused not only conflict between groups, but also facilitated peaceful cooperation.<br/><br/>He proposes a number of ideas for policies, some of which are worthy of discussion. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to give advice in the form of ""this policy needs to be put into place"", with rather weak discussions of how this could be done in a democratically feasible way.

It describes the arguments for liberalism well. But it is terrible because it does not manage to rise over the level of a propaganda piece. The analysis of populism makes interesting points, but it ultimately fails to explain why liberalism has waned and populists have become so successful in the last 20 or so years. The recipe for countering populism is basically just ""more neoliberalism"".<br/><br/>One reason for this failure is that the author seems incapable of entertaining the thought that liberal ideas, policies and government may have internal contradictions and unintended consequences that undermine it. The call for a revival of ""classical liberalism"" is entirely misguided. Reviving a corpse just produces a zombie. Any attempt at revivification of an ideology will inevitably transform it. Indeed, the ""decent classical liberalism"" Karlson advocates bears an uncanny similarity to social liberalism.<br/><br/>This book is a failure, and the fact that so many liberals seem to like it is a  sign that liberals do not understand how bad the situation is.

Översättningen är utmärkt. Det största problemet är upplägget, där Hobbes vill använda geometrins metod att utifrån definitioner och axiom bygga upp teser och bevis. Det gör bokens första kapitel till en ganska trög läsning. Men när Hobbes i kapitel 10 av den första boken kommer in på politiskt mer relevanta frågor, då blir den intressant och bitvis överraskande underhållande. Hobbes räds inte drastiska formuleringar som ibland fick mig att skratta högt.<br/><br/>Hobbes teori om naturtillståndet som alltigenom präglat av skräck, hot och fientlighet mellan människor utgår från vad vi idag skulle kalla ett spelteoretiskt resonemang. Det faktum att vi idag vet att människans förhistoria inte entydigt var så förfärlig, utan till stor del präglades av samarbete och kultur visar att något är fel med Hobbes teori. Den intressanta frågan är vad, och jag ämnar diskutera det i ett annat sammanhang.<br/><br/>Hobbes argument för den allsmäktiga staten är att alla andra alternativ leder till naturtillståndet, vilket innebär anarki och elände. Han försöker att värja sig mot kritiken att statens totala envälde skulle leda till maktmissbruk, men hand argument är i själva verket ganska svaga. Den fråga som hans verk ställer - hur kan statens existens berättigas? - blev en av de centrala frågorna i västerländsk politisk filosofi.

The average differences in behavior and physiology between males of females of these species are discussed in the light of evolution, ecology and culture.<br/><br/>He does not agree with the view that there are no significant differences between the sexes in humans. He rejects the blank slate view of human nature. But neither does he agree with the idea that such differences automatically can tell us what is socially, ethically or politically right or wrong. He is very clear about the fundamental impact that culture has on sex and gender, and describes instances of this from chimpanzees and bonobos.<br/><br/>In general, I find his account convincing and well argued.

He is eminently qualified to write this short book. An important attraction of it is the account of the history of the idea of natural selection. He argues that even though Darwin was clear about the importance of natural selection in accounting for evolution, many others, both in the 19th century and later, have construed its role differently. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the book leans too heavily on explicating the history of ideas in general, and Darwin's account in particular.

I am also somewhat puzzled that some of the quotes Ruse uses do not really illustrate what he claims that they do.

And the critics have often insinuated that this analysis has been normatively loaded; humans as perfect cogs in the machinery of capitalism. The accusation is that this is how economics wants people to behave. Lionel Page does not use this line of attack in his book. Rather, given the various empirically determined biases, he asks: if the actual behavior of humans is often significantly different from that predicted by the rational-actor model, then why is it so? Instead of scrapping the idea of the rational actor, he uses it as a starting point to figure out what the mechanisms are that cause these departures.<br/><br/>This is, in my mind, the best way to deal with the issue. Beginning with a baseline of rationality, defined in some way, the investigation in why it is not adhered to in particular cases might give us interesting insights into what is going on. Is the particular model of rationality mistaken or limited in some way? Are some unaccounted-for mechanisms active? Do we need to consider other factors? If so, what are they? So, instead of just tossing out the idea of the rational actor, an analysis of exactly how and why it fails may give us vital information.<br/><br/>The framework of economics since at least the beginning of the twentieth century has been based on the idea of the rational actor. This is an idealized person who acts selfishly with clear goals and does so according to logical reasoning about preferences and how to satisfy them according to the situation. But in the last 30 or so years, the focus has increasingly been aimed at the fact that we humans systematically deviate in many ways from this idealized actor. There have been many studies in economy, psychology, behavioral science and related fields that find different kinds of biases in how humans act and think various situations.<br/><br/>Lionel Page's aim in this book is to apply an overarching framework of evolutionary thinking to explain the many disparate results. His argument is that many of the seemingly biased or flawed human behaviors are actually perfectly reasonable adaptive solutions to practical problems. Hence the title of the book: Optimally irrational. Page initially makes a very simple point: if we humans are stupid, irrational and generally inept, as some have interpreted the results of behavioral studies, then how come we are still around? Should not evolution have disposed of humans if they were so badly flawed?<br/><br/>Page summarizes a huge amount of scientific results and presents it in a very accessible manner. His descriptions and arguments are clear and concise. In general, I find them persuasive and thought-provoking. For instance, in choosing between several different options, we almost never have complete information, and obtaining complete information would be prohibitively expensive. So if we want to make a choice, we will have to decide when to make the choice given the remaining uncertainties. That is why rules-of-thumb and gut feeling are required. They are effort-saving devices, that usually produce results that are good enough. But in certain situations they fail. We do not have to feel like lesser human beings for choosing among alternatives just based on a feeling.<br/><br/>Another example is the fact that the absolute level of some good (health, income, etc) does not seem to determine how satisfied we are with the current state of affairs. Rather, it is the comparison of our level to some reference point that matters. Why? Page presents several different possible explanations which are all very interesting.<br/><br/>Page ends his book with a very interesting discussion on the history of the idea of rationality in economics, and how it relates to the place of psychology in that science. For example, one criterion of rationality of choice is called the axiom of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Given a specific set of alternatives, the preferred choice among those should not be affected by the addition of another irrelevant alternative. But this is often violated. Page cites a scenario invented by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen: Jane has the choice of going home to John for a drink, or to decline the invitation. She is tempted to go. But then John adds that he can also offer Jane some cocaine. Now, if Jane does not want to take any cocaine, it ought to be rational for her to accept the invitation for a drink and just say no to the cocaine. The availability of cocaine is an irrelevant alternative. But in fact, we would not be surprised if she decides that she no longer wants to go for a drink at John's. The irrelevant alternative has affected her choice.<br/><br/>Page ends his book with advice to his fellow economists: They need to try to figure out why people do things as they do, empirically, and enrich their models of behavior to reflect the evolutionary origins of human preferences, and to take into account the constraints, uncertainties and social strategic dilemmas that are an inescapable part of human existence.<br/>",,,1,0

Its thesis is that free will is an illusion and that the criminal justice system therefore is fundamentally flawed. I believe this is untenable. Interestingly, Sapolsky seems to acknowledge that his view has weird consequences: ""If we deny free will when it comes to he worst of our behaviors, the same must also apply to the best. [...] I can't really imagine how to live your life as if there is no free will."" This undercuts his own accusation against free will, namely that it is absurd; his alternative is also, apparently, absurd.<br/><br/>Sapolsky argues from the standpoint of deterministic materialism. In that world view, there is no room for logic, knowledge or moral values. And no, one does not have to be religious to acknowledge that those things also exist in the universe, along with physical entities. Sapolsky does not seem to realize that a universe that is purely materialistic implies that the book he has written contains no knowledge, arguments, or moral reasoning, just some markings in black paint printed on paper which reflects light that just happens to activate certain neurons in the reader's brain. The book, in his universe, does not transmit knowledge, just signals. I wonder if he accepts that conclusion.",,,1,0

My views on the subject have been substantially modified by his arguments.<br/><br/>In particular, I find his emphasis on the complexity of the process to be inspiring. In contrast to the general idea that there must be some single factor that is fundamentally responsible for the difference between the species Homo sapiens and its closest relatives, Henrich builds a case that many different factors are important, and that their interplay was essential in driving human evolution. Once the first tentative steps into man's cultural addiction were taken, the playing field tilted, as it were, to favor even more culture, including social and political norms, eventually giving rise to the modern human society.

This slowly broke down the clan-oriented social system, which led to the rise of other types of social organization, such as self-governing towns and guilds. And this in turn led to meritocracy and further on to the ideas of the rights of individuals.<br/><br/>The interplay between policy, material conditions, and the evolutionary developments of social systems is one of the most important themes of this book.

And is it self-evident that being anti-woke is the same as being on the political right? Judging by the way many activists and intellectuals are positioning themselves, it seems that there are only two possible positions: Either one is woke and left, or anti-woke and right. The moral philosopher Susan Neiman does not accept this. Her book ""Left is Not Woke"" is an impassioned defense of Enlightenment ideals over the ideas that, in her analysis, powers the woke agenda. And those Enlightenment ideals are not the ideals of the right.<br/><br/>A very loud and divisive debate surrounds the term ""woke"". Politicians such as the American right-wing presidential candidate and one-time Trump sycophant Ron DeSantis use it as a rhetorical weapon against anyone to the left of him. In his usage, any liberal is woke, and therefore an adversary. But there is also a debate among liberals and others who consider themselves on the left about the the ideas usually considered to be ""woke"". This debate is independent of the fulminations of the Trump crowd.<br/><br/>In Neiman's view, woke has become a politics of symbols instead of social change. Its relentless focus on marginalization, inequalities and historical crimes leads it to the conclusion that politics, in the common sense, is impossible, and that some very ill-defined and vague revolution is needed. A political agenda for justice and progress, as commonly understood, is derided as hopelessly naive.<br/><br/>Neiman considers herself a leftist, not a liberal, so her arguments differ in some ways from those of Yascha Mounk in his recent ""The Identity Trap"" (which I have reviewed). But there are also important similarities. One such is the explicit affirmation of ""universalism over tribalism, a firm distinction between justice and power, and a belief in the possibility of progress."" Both writers are champions of universalism, and both argue that one of the main problems with wokeness is that it embraces tribalism.<br/><br/>Another difference between Neiman and Mounk is that Mounk's text is rather dryly analytical and a little too much like an academic lecture. Neiman is an academic, to be sure, but her text is much more passionate and therefore has more life than Mounk's, although it is less well structured. Neiman is on a mission. There is a barely contained rage at the betrayal she feels the woke movement has committed against the Enlightenment ideals. So even if the levels of difficulty of the two texts are about similar, Neiman's is an easier read, because there is a force in it that sweeps one along.<br/><br/>Neiman adds one very important aspect to the analysis of the intellectual roots of wokeness. Not only does she investigate Michel Foucault's standpoints and arguments, and finds them in the final analysis anti-political and cynical. She also has a look at how the thinking of two Nazi intellectuals, the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the legal theorist Carl Schmitt, has influenced the debate. I criticized Mounk's book for not doing this, so I am very pleased that Neiman digs into the topic. The anti-liberalism of Heidegger and Schmitt has impressed some on the left, and some of their arguments have been taken up in the leftist discourse. This has influenced the woke movement, especially the contemptuous attitude towards ideas such as justice and progress, which Heidegger and Schmitt considered as hypocrisy and sham ideals.<br/><br/>Neiman's text also contains a discussion of evolutionary psychology. I must confess that I am slightly baffled by this. It is not clear why she feels this has a place in the current discussion. She does make good points about how some have taken arguments from evolutionary psychology to make reactionary political points. She ties evolutionary psychology to the argument that we are inherently tribal, and that its view of human nature is cynical in the same way as Foucault's is. I am not convinced.<br/><br/>A great aspect of Neiman's text is her passionate defense of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment has been accused of hypocritically talking about human rights, while at the same time condoning and even furthering racist notions of the West being inherently superior to the colonized peoples of the New World and the South. Refreshingly, Neiman will have none of it. She points out that several of the major Enlightenment writers found inspiration in the different ways of living discovered in other parts of the world. This became part of their critique of the Western societies they lived in. She writes: ""Enlightenment thinkers invented the critique of Eurocentrism and were the first to attack colonialism, on the basis of universalist ideas."" The Enlightenment ideals have affected Western societies, but not all that happened in the West, or came out of it, can be blamed on those ideals. Other philosophies and forces were also at play. To say that Enlightenment equals the West and all its actions is just stupid.<br/><br/>The influence and effects of woke thinking is very different in countries such as the US, Great Britain and Sweden, partly due to the differing impact the ideas have had in academic environments. In the US, the use of so-called DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) statements as a tool for selection of students and academic staff at colleges and universities has become widespread. This amounts to a selection by political affiliation. As a way to shut out non-woke persons from academia, this is clearly very bad news for an open society. Such statements have, as far as I am aware, not seen the light of day in Sweden except possibly in a few isolated cases, and I believe there is little danger that they will become any more common. Of course, fads from the US do tend to make their way into Sweden at one point or another, so one never knows. Neiman's analysis is important even if woke ideas have not yet had the level of negative effects that they have had in some areas of the US society.<br/><br/>In summary, Susan Neiman's book adds a very important perspective to the debate. As a liberal, I do not agree with every point, but her analysis is hard-hitting in many ways, and it deserves to be widely read. It would be nice if its message could come across so that the simplistic equations of left=woke and anti-woke=right could be seen for what they are: false.",,,1,0

In older literature, the role of cooperation between males in hunting and conflict has often been the focus. Here, the roles of different generations of women in the family and in human groups is described as a major force in the evolution, in some epochs being the main force. I find this aspect of the book to be both convincing and fascinating.<br/><br/>The book continuously stresses the importance of culture in our evolution. Human nature is to be cultural. Indeed, in the epilogue of the book, the authors go as far as saying that the idea of ""human nature"" should be abandoned, since culture has become so important for us that we with its help are active participants in the evolution of our behavior. I do not agree that the idea of ""human nature"" should be scrapped. I think the idea of ""human nature"" is still important, since without it we cannot explain e.g. why we are so hyper-cooperative as compared to all our closest evolutionary relatives. But I do agree that the currently widespread idea of ""human nature"" as a single, discrete, well-defined entity must be thoroughly updated.<br/><br/>I found this to be one of the best recent synthesis of the story of us humans that I have read.

Nichola Raihani writes very well, and manages to explain scientific results and theoretical arguments in a very accessible manner. Beginning with cooperation on the level of genes, she goes on to explain how cooperation is the basis for multicellular life, continuing to cooperation between individual organisms. As part of the package, we get a very good description of how evolution works in general.<br/><br/>What I like most about her account is the emphasis that evolution does not prescribe one single solution to the problem of life. The slogan ""survival of the fittest"" is often taken to imply that ""fitness"" is simple and straightforward, and can therefore be achieved in only one way. This is not so. There are many ways of living, many possible strategies, and the context, including ecology, climate, genetics, and simple randomness, affect the outcome. Connected to this is also the important point made by Raihani that if we want to understand human sociality, it is not self-evident that we should look at our closest evolutionary relatives, such as the great apes. Rather, we should look at other species whose ecological and genetic context is similar in relevant aspects. The meerkats or the naked mole-rats have more in common regarding certain aspects of their social lives with humans, in spite of their more distant evolutionary relationships.<br/><br/>An important theme in the latter part of the book, where Raihani discusses how evolution has formed Homo sapiens, is the notion of social dilemmas. We are a profoundly social species, but being social implies its own built-in contradictions, such as the Tragedy of the commons, where the use of a common resource needs to be carefully managed, but each individual has an incentive to use it to the fullest, thereby collectively overusing it. How this problem can be solved is an important research topic with Elinor Ostrom as a central figure. This work is discussed by Raihani in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and the current climate crisis.<br/><br/>If there is one point of criticism, it would be her treatment of culture. The special role of cumulative culture, including norms, in human affairs is discussed by Raihani, but somehow I feel that she is not giving it the weight it should have in her discussion. Discussing hunter-gatherer societies, she seems to suggest that they were more similar than societies are today; this is, I think, wrong. Anthropological studies rather indicate the opposite. Hunter-gatherers were probably very culturally diverse. But this is a minor point in an otherwise highly readable book, which I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject.",,,1,0

Är det inte litet förmätet att säga något kritiskt? Det uppenbara först: Charles Darwins teori om evolutionen är en av vetenskapens största framsteg. I boken samlar han ihop en mängd olika argument för den, och diskuterar dem med en kombination av skärpa och ödmjukhet. Han redovisar sådant som han anser utgör svåra problem för teorin. Men det är inte svårt att se varför, trots allt, så många av de som läste boken lät sig övertygas. Boken är inte alls den torra traktat som man skulle kunna föreställa sig, utan en levande och resonerande text.<br/><br/>Det som förvånade mig mest är hur mycket Darwin använder sig av observationer från husdjursavel i sin argumentation. Jag hade visserligen hört om hans avel av duvor, men att den aspekten används så mycket, och med sådan kraft, överraskade mig litet grann.<br/><br/>Med tanke på den centrala position som genetik och genomik har idag, så är Darwins diskussion om ärftlighetens mysterier ytterst frustrerande. Man vill skrika tvärs över de ca 170 år som gått sedan publikationen: GENER, Darwin, det handlar om GENER! Något liknande gäller hans diskussion om hur arter har spritts till olika världsdelar, där man så gärna vill berätta för honom om Wegeners kontinentaldriftsteori.<br/><br/>Detta sagt, över till min kritik. Bokens text innehåller en hel del repetititioner. Visst, det kan behövas i en argumenterande skrift. Men mitt intryck är att texten inte har redigerats riktigt så som borde ha skett. Det visade sig att Alfred Russel Wallace ungefär samtidigt oberoende hade kommit till samma insikter om evolutionens principer som Darwin. Detta tvingade Darwin att skriva boken, så är det förståeligt att det gick litet snabbt. Men jag tror boken hade blivit mycket bättre med en hård men rättvis redaktör.<br/><br/>Men den är, som sagt, en klassiker. Den bör läsas.",,,1,0

As the subtitle has it, the goal of the book is ""reconstructing the role and nature of morality."" It attempts to analyze how ethics came into being. How did humans invent, or discover, ethics? A description of how ethics fits in with human evolution could potentially tell us a lot about both humans and ethics. But the way this book goes about it does not, in my mind, deliver the goods. The starting point is not very believable, and the explicit constraints put on the narrative by the author do not help. The result is disappointing. In fact, the most useful part of the book is the criticism of its main text by Michael Tomasello in a short section at the end.<br/><br/>The narrative begins with Erewhon, a hypothetical human society in which people can communicate by natural language, but in which ethics or morality as such does not exist. Pettit is explicit that this is a thought experiment. Erewhon has not actually existed. The question Pettit poses is: Given this state, how has ethics emerged? In my mind, this makes his narrative vulnerable to the same kind of criticism that can be leveled at John Rawls theory of justice, or for that matter at any hypothetical tale of how a social contract has been arrived at. The starting point is always open to criticism: Why define the starting point in exactly those terms? There is always the worry that the starting point has been designed to produce the justification of a particular moral theory that one desires. That is, the argument is not really a derivation from axioms, as it purports to be, but rather a construction of a particular set of axioms that gives the requested result.<br/><br/>Pettit posits several constraints on the narrative: it must be naturalistic, i.e. it cannot invoke any supernatural interventions. Fair enough; we are not interested in yet another explanation of ethics that tries to avoid Euthyphro's dilemma as stated by Plato. Another constraint is that the narrative must not rely on luck. Pettit view is that the emergence of ethics from within Erewhon must be a process that more or less inevitably had to follow. To rely on luck for this process to occur would be a kind of cheating, is my interpretation. To some extent, I can understand why Pettit imposes this constraint. But this unfortunately means that the theory will be proving too much. Evolution, in actual fact, and the emergence of novel features that it entails, contains an essential component of randomness, luck if you will. At no point in the evolutionary history of the ancestors of us humans was it inevitable that Homo sapiens would emerge. Therefore the idea that a narrative of how ethics emerged must rely on inevitability is too strong. It proves too much.<br/><br/>Tomasello's criticism of Pettit's text relates to the issue of cooperation. When Pettit starts his narrative with the existence of human language as a means of communication, Tomasello asks whether it is not in fact cooperation that was the starting point for why we even invented language. In his view, morality starts with the problems caused by cooperation, and language is a secondary issue in that respect. I notice that the cover of the book shows a painting ""Group of five men working with a net"". The men are not primarily talking, they are collaborating.<br/><br/>The book is not an easy text to read. At times, it seems that there is no progress in the argument, simply a stating and restating of a number of thesis, again and again. It has a number of words that recur in a vast array of permutations, such as ""desiderata"", ""avowal"" and ""pledging"". There is a lot of splitting up of issues into multiple subarguments in ways that do not contribute to clarity. Given the weakness of the argument, I cannot really recommend it.",,,1,0

Has evolution focused our moral sense to consider only the group to which we belong ? Allen Buchanan thinks it is obvious that the two Great Expansions, as he calls them, shows that this cannot be the case. The first Great Expansion is the inclusion of all humans in the moral sphere, that is, the ideal of universality, that all humans, as humans, have equal moral standing. The second Great Expansion is the view that also (some) animals have a moral standing, that mistreatment of animals is a moral problem. These two expansions do not make sense if one takes for granted that the human moral sense has evolved solely as a regulator of tribal life.<br/><br/>Buchanan, an accomplished philosopher, criticizes several authorities who, he thinks, do not consider the fact of the two Great Expansions, or at least make statements that do not reflect taking it seriously. A central line in the criticism is aimed at two dogmas that Buchanan thinks need to be demolished: The Cooperation dogma, which states that since morality arose as a solution to fundamental problems of cooperation, that is all it is. Wrong, says Buchanan. Morality has outgrown its origins.<br/><br/>The second is the Tribalism dogma, that we are morally hardwired for tribalism due to our evolutionary history. In contrast, Buchanan proposes that we have a flexible moral sense, which is expressed as different moral attitudes depending on the context. If the environment permits, our moral mind moves in the direction of universality, away from tribalism. The economic growth of the last few centuries, and many concomitant societal changes, form the basis for such a change in our moral sense, and is the basis for the two Great Expansions. Buchanan makes clear that this development is by no means deterministic. Backsliding into tribalism is perfectly possible, and can be seen to occur, illustrated by many developments in the current political climate in the democratic world.<br/><br/>The writing is clear and forceful. The author really wants to make his position clear, which is so refreshing. However, he overdoes it at times, reiterating points that have already been made. On the other hand, the summary of his argument that makes up the last chapter is actually a very good way of ending the book.<br/><br/>Unusually in this genre, there is an extensive discussion of the state of contemporary politics, and what to do about current issues. Buchanan analyses the current polarization in much of the democratic world as a form of intrasocietal tribalism, and discusses the societal features and developments that have led to it. I find this part important and suggestive, but also a little thin. I cannot really fault the author for this, since I cannot provide any better analysis. The lack of concrete ideas to overcome the current stalemate is shared by most writers. If Buchanan's text can provoke further thinking in this direction, then it has performed its duty.<br/><br/>This is a highly interesting and thought-provoking book. It deserves to be discussed broadly, by scientists, philosophers and the general public.",,,1,0

The question was famously raised by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. His answer was controversial, to say the least. He did not have much information to base his analysis on, given that the discovery of humanity being a product of Darwinian evolution was yet to be made. Although there was some information about how hunter-gatherers lived in parts of the world that were being colonized by European traders and settlers, it was fragmentary at best. The book ""The Creation of Inequality"" by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus does the hard work of summarizing the anthropological and archaeological record to identify the stages and processes that transformed human society from the large degree of equality that characterized nomadic hunter-gatherers (ignoring gender inequality) before about 12,000 years ago. It is a monumental effort, and the results give them the basis to provide some more facts-based answers to Rousseau's question.<br/><br/>Flannery and Marcus present short histories of a large number of societies based on their reading of the available evidence. The focus is to identify markers that give information about the level and type of inequality, political and social changes, and the growth and decay of the societies. The examples range from the Pacific archipelagos, the Central American jungles, the plains of Sumer, to the different Indian societies on North America and more. It is a fascinating account of the diversity of human societies, but there are also many recurring patterns. Flannery and Marcus analyze these patterns in terms of changes of the social logic as a result of the interactions between the natural, political, and spiritual environment with the inventions that were needed to solve day-to-day problems. Several different societies went through changes and stages that display many similarities, despite being far separated from each other in time and space, and having no knowledge of each other. Independent processes displaying similarities are good indicators that there must be some underlying common propensities.<br/><br/>A theme that becomes clear is that one important step providing a foundation for inequality was the formation of more or less permanent settlements. These did not have to be based on agriculture; there are examples of hunter-gatherers that lived in environments with sufficient resources for people to get by without having to move around. This allowed the creation and accumulation private property. Another theme is the forming of achievement-based hierarchies: Persons (men, usually) who were successful gained prestige and could become chiefs, while less successful persons became commoners or even slaves. However, the chiefs could not automatically pass on their status to their children. That would require further social inventions.<br/><br/>The account is complex and wide-ranging. Each society or region is dealt with in separate chapters. One important point is the difference between hereditary inequality in its various shapes, and achievement-based inequality. One point they make is that hereditary inequality can be inferred when the graves of children contain items of luxury and symbols of power; since they could not have achieved this themselves, it indicates that their status depends on inheritance. The historical record shows that the move from achievement-based inequality to hereditary inequality is not inevitable. However, the social logic works strongly in this direction given certain environmental conditions. Formation of large-scale states are most often the result of competition between neighboring chiefdoms.<br/><br/>I cannot vouch for the accuracy of their historical accounts. But the general approach seems sensible, and they do point out when they regard the available data to be insufficient for conclusions to be drawn. I do not get the impression that the authors are trying to push an agenda through tendentious reporting. The book is rather long since the authors cover many different societies, and at times it is hard to keep up with the wealth of details. However, it is hard to see how it could have been done differently without losing the concreteness that is the unique point of their approach.<br/><br/>A question is posed in the final chapter: How can our current societies be made more egalitarian? One response is: Put hunter-gatherers in charge. It is a provoking thought. Exactly how this could be achieved is left unspecified. The authors do not discuss our current Western societies in any depth. They are based on meritocracy, rather than aristocracy and monarchy, at least notionally. This means that modern societies have an ideological basis that implies greater political equality than in the preceding historical era. But at the same time material inequality has increased. How do we analyse the social logic that has produced this state of affairs, and how do we want to change it? This book provides much food for thought about these vital issues.",,,1,0

Humans are cooperative, not only for mutual gain, but also altruistically. We care for one another. This entails not only the welfare of each other, but also in the upholding of norms that are part of the particular culture we live in. How did the peculiar behavior evolve?<br/><br/>The most common explanations invoke kin and reciprocity. Kin relationships can and do underlie altruistic behavior among many species. Reciprocity is rare among animals, but could in principle be invoked for some types of altruism. But Bowles and Gintis conclude that these do not sufficiently explain human cooperative behavior. Social preferences such as cooperating with unrelated people  even in cases when reciprocity is unlikely, and the propensity to punish free-riders and cheats even when doing so is costly, require other explanations.<br/><br/>The discussion is exhaustive, and in parts exhausting. The authors recapitulate very technical treatments of models and simulations, primarily relating to evolutionary theory and game theory approaches to cooperation. However, the reason is that they wish to show that the effects of kin and reciprocity cannot quantitatively account for the full extent of human cooperation. It is one thing to argue the qualitative effects, but another to show that the numbers add up. Bowles and Gintis goes through the formulae and numbers in detail, which is necessary, but heavy going for an amateur.<br/><br/>The authors argue that more is required to explain the evolution of human cooperation. Their answer is the co-evolution of institutions and group-mindedness, where culture and group competition act as critical factors. The driving force was the between-group competition that operated during Homo sapiens early evolution. This included the survival (or not) of groups of people in the harsh environment by inventing and maintaining the appropriate tools (in a wide sense) to deal with the challenges. It also included the inter-group competition and conflicts that could determine which one survived and which not.<br/><br/>Bowles and Gintis write that the ""individual motives and group-level institutions that account for cooperation among humans include not only the most elevated, including a concern for others, fair-mindedness, and democratic accountability of leaders, but also the most wicked, such as vengeance, racism. religious bigotry and hostility towards outsiders."" The ability to be good as well as evil has been our blessing and curse since our species evolved. It is our heritage.",,,1,0

That is, in order to argue about political issues, one has to first sort out morality. The philosopher David Schmidtz argues in his book ""Living together. Inventing moral science"" that it is the other way around. The problem of how to live together, that is, politics, is primary. Morality then becomes part of the solution. The question ""how to live together?"" is more fundamental than ""how to live?"".<br/><br/>The book takes the form of a set of separate essays which are arranged to fit together. This is successful up to a point; a few of the chapters do not really contribute all that much to the main theme. It makes for an uneven reading experience. Some of the chapters are excellent, with insights that make you think, while a few are more technical and not very inspiring.<br/><br/>Schmidtz uses the term ""moral science"". This refers to the constellation of subject fields such as social science, philosophy, economy, anthropology, etc, which can or could contribute to the study of how humans could live together and flourish. During the Scottish Enlightenment, whose main figures were David Hume and Adam Smith, moral and political philosophy was an empirical project. Their salient question was ""what works?"". However during the 1800s, and even more strongly during the 1900s, the discussion changed topic to ""how to act?"". This was a change for the worse, in Schmidtz view.<br/><br/>Schmidtz points out that in a world where there are multiple agents, each with their own project(s), it is not enough to just consider how to act. One must include the fact that others will respond from the very beginning of the analysis. These others will not necessarily want to act according to your wishes, and they will not have the same goals. Every act of yours will entail a response from them which will affect the outcome. Living together implies having to deal with this. Moral and political philosophy must therefore seriously consider the problems of living together and the strategies that can be employed to solve these problems. Schmidtz accuses, among others, John Rawls for making assumptions which amount to serious evasions of several basic conundrums of life in a society. Strategy is essential and cannot be approximated away.<br/><br/>The book contains a very interesting discussion of idealist versus realist positions in moral and political philosophy. One important strand here is the argument that justice cannot be derived from axioms, but is instead an evolving response to the human condition. Empiricism, in a certain sense, must be the focus, rather than deductively arguing from first principles.<br/><br/>I am intrigued and happy to see that David Schmidtz towards the end of the book makes explicit the point that I believe is implicit in how he starts out his argument. Namely, that one must consider the evolutionary history of the human species to fully understand justice and morality. He writes: ""We are social and political animals, and justice is a human adaption to an ecological niche."" In a chapter written with Jason Brennan titled ""A Brief History of the Human Condition"", there is a description of how important cooperation is for humans, and how it has evolved and formed our species. I wish that this would have been the starting chapter of the book, because this story is in fact central to how moral and political philosophy should be restated.<br/><br/>There are many thoughts and arguments in this book that invite discussion. Indeed, there are many that are not fully developed or joined together in a more coherent fashion. I leave the book with a sense of having seen glimpses of a new start for moral and political philosophy. But it is tentative, which is both good, since it opens the door for further development, and bad, since as it is, the account is too fragmented and does not form a sustained and complete argument.",,,1,0

Mounk thinks the terms ""identity politics"", ""critical race theory"" and ""woke"" have been so thoroughly laden with rhetorical baggage that he wants to stay away from them, and therefore uses ""identity synthesis"" instead.<br/><br/>The analysis is very well structured, and traces the evolution of these ideas from Michel Foucault, Edward Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, and others, to the more recent texts from Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X Kendi. The earlier influences from Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt are not included in this analysis. Intriguingly, Mounk proposes that a lot of what is now known as ""woke"" standpoints and phraseology was born in discussions on the social media site Tumblr, rather than on Facebook or Twitter.<br/><br/>Mounk's criticism of the ""identity synthesis"" is that it becomes a trap, since by rejecting universalism and the ideal of a society that has moved beyond racial categories, the supposed radical stance actually becomes regressive. For instance, so-called standpoint theory facilitates tribalism, it is not an antidote.<br/><br/>The book concludes with a kind of manual: ""How to escape the identity trap"". It posits three possible scenarios for how the identity synthesis might fare in the public debate: First, that it is too late to escape the identity trap. We are condemned to tribalistic fights for group-based privileges and woke purges of so-called ""violence"", i.e. disagreement. The second scenario is that there will be increasing push-back against moral panics and performative acts, which will discourage the ""woke"" movement into retreat. The third scenario is that some, but not all, of the concepts and ideas of the identity synthesis will become entrenched in the general debate, and cause continued clashes for many years to come. This is what Mounk believes will happen, unless a principled stance against the identity synthesis can grow strong.<br/><br/>So what to do? Mounk says that the reason he wrote the book was to help ordinary people point out the dangers of the identity trap, as a way to counteract its most dangerous effects. He gives some advice: do not apologize for believing in the universalist position, do not vilify those who disagree, remember that some who agree with some of your arguments may disagree with others (and that is fine), and finally, do not become a reactionary just to be in opposition to the identity synthesis.<br/><br/> The analysis, criticism and description of the liberal alternative are very clearly stated, and the text can be used a a handbook. However, even if the author is clearly very engaged in the issue, the text does have a tone of a university lecture. Somehow, it is a bit too restrained.",,,1,0

Altruism, selfishness, group formation, compassion, enmity and many other topics are discussed from the evolutionary point of view. Culture has emerged out of human sociality, but as any emergent phenomenon, it partially transcends its origins, and becomes a force of its own.<br/><br/>Pagel argues that once culture got started, maybe 200,000 years ago, it quickly caused a very strong evolutionary pressure for humans to become better at interacting with each other in a cultural setting. Culture became a new, vast ecological niche. The changes accelerated by approximately 40,00 years ago, and Pagel speculates that this is due to strong selection for cultural competence.<br/><br/>The discussion stresses the conflicts between different strategies and solutions to problems of cooperation and survival that is the human condition. There is a strong undercurrent in much political philosophy that there is - has to be - some kind of unity underlying the awful complexity o the conflict-ridden reality. This book carefully explains why this is not so. ""Our societies are perched on a shaky pillar of conflicting interests."" Our excellent cooperation skills may be due to the conflicts between groups that occur routinely in our social lives.<br/><br/>Pagel discusses creativity in a particularly sharp way. We humans are not masters of creativity. Rather, our culture relies on us being extremely good imitators and learners, rather than inventors of new ideas. We are hyper-imitators, often copying actions that are not strictly necessary to achieve a specific goal.<br/><br/>There are many more topics covered in this book. It is worth reading.",,,1,0

It is, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. That said, the various contributions do make up a fairly diverse and well-presented set of viewpoints. What does the idea of human nature mean? What is it supposed to do? Is it meaningful in light of the combined influence of nature and culture on human existence?<br/><br/>Tim Lewens writes a nice introduction to both the debate in general, and the contributions in this volume.<br/><br/>Edouard Machery defends his nomological account of human nature: It characterizes human nature as a set of traits that human beings tend to possess as a result of the evolution of their species. The traits need not be distinctive of humans, nor need they be shared by all humans; they merely need to be typical. I have some sympathy with this view, but there are problems, for instance with the trait of sex: is being male of female typical? Clearly that trait, having two possible values (yes, that is another debate) should be included, but it appears that the nomological account does not do that.<br/><br/>Grant Ramsey offers an alternative in the shape of a trait bin and trait cluster account. Here, traits come in a limited set of possible combinations, that may vary over a human being's life. It can therefore handle the development of a human being. This approach also seems able to handle the influence of culture, broadly construed, over a human being's life. My own views are closest to this account, although I would present it differently.<br/><br/>Karola Stots and Paul Griffiths emphasises the developmental trajectory of a human being, and how various influences overtime mould the human being. They argue that human nature is not embodied in one input to development, such as the genome. Organisms are fundamentally processes, they say, and therefore a developmental systems account is most appropriate. I sympathize, but I am not entirely clear what it means in concrete terms.<br/><br/>Cecilia Heyes thinks the idea of human nature should be patched up rather than eliminated. She discusses the idea of natural pedagogy as a concrete example of how one could discuss one facet of human nature. Natural pedagogy proposes that human infants genetically inherit a well-organised package of biases, tendencies and skills making them receptive to deliberate attempts by adults to convey information. She analyses the evidence for the genetic basis and finds it to be weak. She suggests that a hybrid of the nomological view and what she refers to as ""evolutionary causal essentialism"" might be fruitful. She thinks ""Mother Culture"" does a lot of the hard work in preparing children to be taught. I am not fully convinced by her arguments, but they require some serious thought.<br/><br/>John Dupré wants to view humans as processes. He says that seeing human behaviour as a uniquely developed capacity for flexible response to the environment makes it unsurprising that it is difficult to provide a definite account of human behaviour. Even though he says that humans are neither blank slates, nor machines with a predetermined programme, he ends up saying that since the notion of human nature is commonly associated with a set of fixed properties, it is safest to dispense with its use altogether. I find this conclusion fundamentally dissatisfying. If humans have a uniquely developed capacity for flexible responses, then that is part of human nature.<br/><br/>Kim Sterelny says that a kind of field guide description of humans is possible, but that that would not be the same as a theory of human nature. He thinks the idea of an evolutionary ""key innovation"" that set humans apart from their immediate ancestors is mistaken. Human evolution is based on positive feedback between multiple factors and capabilities. The idea of human nature masks this complicated evolutionary history. Sterelny's discussion is multifaceted and highly interesting and goes on to culture and cooperation as essential parts of the story. But as for the other human-nature-skeptical essays, I am not convinced that it shows that there is no place for an empirical description of human nature.<br/><br/>Kevin Laland and Gillian Brown are on the war path against the idea of a human nature, and demolish three different conceptions of it. Either they are untenable, or they do not do any real work. They emphasize the plastic nature of human development. They concede that certain aspects of behavioural development exhibit consistency and stability over space and time, but their focus is on plasticity and gene-culture coevolution. At the end of the day, their argument seems to boil down to the statement that the idea of human nature is somehow dangerous. My point: that does not invalidate it.<br/><br/>Peter Richerson thinks that whether one is for or against the idea of human nature is correlated with how strongly one commits to the tenets of the Modern Synthesis. He argues as if the coevolution of genes and culture is forbidden by, or at least not handled by the Modern Synthesis. I do not see that he makes that case. He discusses the ideas of a number of thinkers in brief sketches, and makes the case that the gene-culture coevolution idea is an alternative to human nature. I appreciated the many insights that his text contains, but I am not fully convinced. I do not quite see why accepting the fundamental influence of culture on human evolution in and by itself invalidates the idea of a human nature.<br/><br/>Christina Toren attempts to provide an anthropological point of view. Unfortunately, this text evinces excruciating verbiage. That is, it excels in using many difficult words and convoluted sentences. I find it hard to distil anything of interest out of it. The main point seems to be that one should study human ontogeny as a microhistorical process. Ok? She says we need a unified model of human being. The distinction between nature and culture must go. At the end, she displays her woke credentials in a garbled sentence that says: ""It seems obvious to me that an acknowledgement that ontogeny is through and through a historical process would put paid to ideas of 'culture' and 'human nature' and, in so doing, provide for a proper understanding of how certainly we condemn future generations to a deepening of the inequalities and injustices that we are failing to address."" I find the latter part incomprehensible. It reads as if her proposal would deepen inequalities, which is obviously not her intent. But what have inequalities do to with any of this, anyway?<br/><br/>Maria Kronenfeldner describes seven reasons why there is disagreement about human nature. She points out that nature and culture are almost always used in a dualistic, antithetical pair, but that reference to nature has usually been done as a move to impose a certain kind of authoritative understanding. She reviews the use of the concept of nature from the Greeks via the Enlightenment and the early days of Darwinism with Francis Galton as a central figure. She goes on to the development of cultural anthropology by Alfred Kroeber. She concludes that the former essentialist idea of nature has been replaced by three scientific concepts: a classificatory, a descriptive, and an explanatory nature. This is an interesting historical review. Its goal is not to propose a particular view of human nature.<br/><br/>And there concludes the book.",,,1,0

It deals with the potential for use and abuse of DNA technology, and describes the history of the debate around this topic since the dawn of molecular biology in the 1950's. Cobb is an active researcher in fruit fly biology and the author of several books on different aspects of biomedical research.<br/><br/>The discussion is far-ranging and detailed, at times perhaps a bit too detailed. However, there are several topics and stories that are brought to life which I, having worked in related fields for a long time, did not know about. And for those topics which I did know about before reading this book, I have been unable to detect any factual errors.<br/><br/>Although the author is opinionated, I do not find this to be a problem in itself. He does not let his opinions bias the description in any substantial way. However, I am not entirely happy about the discussion. It is not very well structured, and at times feels like a record of the author's thinking, rather than a measured and considered argument. He argues that important developments must first be discussed and agreed-upon by consensus in the general public (what are the chances of consensus for anything?), at the same time as scientists should themselves assume responsibility for considering whether some new technology should be worked on or not. There seems to be no realization of the potential conflict between these demands; if scientists discuss among themselves whether a technology should be used or not, it can be construed as trying to decide things over the heads of the general public.<br/><br/>That DNA and biomedical technology have great potential is obvious. But as this book clearly explains, having potential is very far from actually delivering the goods. This is both good and bad. Bad because the hopes for new therapies and other useful applications so rarely pan out. Good when it means that the most dire predictions of the terrible power that the new technologies give us rather often turn out to be overblown.<br/><br/>The book ends on a rather down-beat note. Heritable human gene editing gets a well-deserved thrashing as basically a solution looking for a problem. The discussion about the potential dangers of DNA technology has waned during recent years. Are we becoming complacent? The success story of the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, and the use of DNA sequencing for assisting in treatment of rare genetic disorders, are some examples of progress. Other advances such as CAR T-cell therapy may prove to be too expensive and difficult to be anything but niche applications.<br/><br/>In summary, Matthew Cobb's book is a useful overview of the history of the field, but its discussion and conclusions do not quite live up to expectations.",,,1,0

He was also a member of the German Nazi party from 1933 to 1945. Some of those who consider him to be a great philosopher have tried to find ways of explaining away or isolating his Nazism, either as a regrettable necessity in German academia of the day, as a lapse of judgement, or as political naivety. The present book by Richard Wolin demolishes these attempts. Heidegger's Nazism was wholly congruent with, even strongly influenced by, his philosophical outlook. As the so-called Black Notebooks amply illustrate, his antisemitism and German imperialism were genuine expressions of his philosophical analysis of the world situation. Wolin presents many quotes and arguments from Heidegger's writings and makes his case forcefully.<br/><br/>Even though I therefore think this is an important book, I am not entirely happy with its presentation. The terminology inescapably must refer to and use Heidegger's own words, which is bad enough, but Wolin's own arguments are too often couched in phrases that are too much Heidegger for their own good. Words such as ""idiolect"" and ""caesura"" litter the text, which is also at times repetitive, sometimes using the same quote to make similar points in different chapters. I understand that the choice of a thematic structure, rather than, say, a chronological one, leads to this kind of problem, but it hasn't been minimized sufficiently.<br/><br/>Apart from the main discussion of Heidegger's thinking in relation to world events, the book contains a very useful and enlightening chapter on the influence of Heidegger on the New Right in recent times. Wolin traces the relationships between Heidegger and New Right thinkers, politicians and terrorists: among those discussed are the Italian hyperfascist Julius Evola, the Russian reactionary ideologue Alexander Dugin, Brenton Tarrant (the 2019 Christchurch mosque murderer), the American Neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, and Anders Behring Breivik (the 2011 Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer).

Det är ganska mycket å ena sida, å andra sidan. Man skulle kunna kalla den folkpartistisk i sin kluvenhet, men det vore kanske för elakt. Den argumenterar för en konstitutionell stat som kan inrymma stor kulturmångfald och som bygger på majoritetsstyre, rättsstat och fri- och rättigheter till skydd för minoriteter. Trots fokuset på konflikterna kring och om kultur så missar Johansson Heinö en viktig fråga här; mer om det senare i den här kommentaren.<br/><br/>Andreas Johansson Heinö tar upp många nyliga konflikter och debatter och ger i huvudsak goda kortfattade beskrivningar av vad de handlade om. De olika argumenten och verklighetstolkningarna som ligger till grund för dom redovisas i huvudsak bra. Självklart inte helt invändningsfritt. Man får intrycket att konflikterna i Sverige före 1965 handlade mest om ekonomi, men det tror jag inte är rätt beskrivet.<br/><br/>Den nämnda kluvenheten kan exemplifieras med att Johansson Heinö först vill ta åt sig äran av att vara en av de första i Sverige som refererat till den karta som visar olika länders värderingar uppmätta av World Values Survey, och där Sverige ligger i ena hörnet. Senare i boken ondgör han sig över att samma karta används så mycket i debatten.<br/><br/>Ett annat problem är att texten ibland hovrar som en statsvetenskaplig helikopter ovanför skeendena och konflikterna, för att sedan plötsligt och litet slumpmässigt dyka ner och fälla avgöranden. Visserligen heter boken ""Anteckningar från kulturkriget"", men en litet mer sammanhållen argumentation hade varit bra. Ett ytterligare problem är att texten litet för ofta hemfaller åt den tidstypiska sjukan att argumentera genom sarkasm. Om man kan få till en spydig formulering om något, så anses det räcka som motargument.<br/><br/>Det samhällsideal som Johansson Heinö ser framför sig är en konstitutionell stat som bygger på två principer: Majoritetsprincipen, som ska förhindra en elit från att ta över, och en princip om maktdelning och fri- och rättigheter som ska skydda minoriteter. För att upprätthålla detta ideal måste de goda värden som det bygger på frigöras från det nationella kontext i vilken den utvecklats, enligt ett argument taget från den tyske filosofen Jürgen Habermas. I en sådan stat kan liberal demokrati och mångkultur frodas.<br/><br/>Den smärtpunkt som Johansson Heinö aldrig når fram till är denna: Hur ska ett samhälle som präglas av stor kulturmångfald kunna underbygga och vidmakthålla en konstitutionell stat enligt de nämnda principerna? Kräver inte en sådan stat en kulturell och värderingsmässig infrastruktur för att kunna fortleva? Även om det finns institutioner som ska värna principerna, så kommer de att brytas ner och försvagas på lång sikt om det inte finns ett stöd för dem bland en majoritet av befolkningen. Allehanda bromsande regler mot ändringar av grundlagar, etc, kan inte ge mer än tillfällig respit. Grundlagar utan kulturellt stöd är inte mycket värda.<br/><br/>Johansson Heinö önskar rensa ut det nationella och ersätta det med en rent konstitutionellt definierad gemenskap. Han skriver ""att skapa och vidmakthålla den liberala demokratin är ingenting man gör för att det är enkelt utan för att det är svårt."" Ja, det kan man hålla med om.

Den nationalism som just nu utgör en förutsättning för Ukrainas försvar mot det ryska anfallet och ockupationen kan svårligen fördömas av liberaler.

Ibland kanske den närmar sig det ytliga, vilket möjligen är närmast oundvikligt.<br/><br/>En observation som Jalalvand gör är att ""mening uppstår ur sociala interaktioner."" Vilket det ligger mycket i. Hans diskussion om människans sociala egenskaper undebygger det. Avsnittet om moralen innehåller bland annat en redogörelse för Michael Tomasellos forskning som pekar på hur moralen är nära förknippad med människans förmåga, ja, behov, av samarbete. Det är en välgärning att introducera Tomasellos och andras forskning om dessa frågor, debatten skulle berikas av att kunskapen om de resultaten var mer spridda.<br/><br/>Hur ska man då se på det faktum att konflikt och grupptänkande också tycks vara en del av människans natur?

Richard Rhodes gives very good descriptions of the basic facts of the physics and engineering, and also provides an overall comprehensible explanation of the politics of the process. Having some previous knowledge of the basic theory and history of nuclear physics, I cannot find any mistakes or misleading statements of any consequence. As a Swede, I notice that the southern port of Limhamn is misspelled Linhamm.<br/><br/>One important point the author makes is that the realization that the atomic bomb would be a theoretical possibility was inevitable, given any scientific investigation into nuclear physics and chemistry. At no point was there a possibility of containing the knowledge to a select few. However, it is also clear that the actual making of a bomb required a huge engineering effort, which in the end only USA could muster during the Second World War.<br/><br/>Another important point is that the advances in nuclear physics were very much a collective affair. No single discovery by any single scientists was *the* turning point. Multiple discoveries and ideas had to be made for this to progress.<br/><br/>Somewhat appropriately, I finished this book on July 16th, on the anniversary of the Trinity test, the first detonation of a nuclear device ever.

Kropotkin särskiljer inte tydligt på samarbete och ömsesidig hjälp, vilket gör analysen svag.

The book describes the benefits, challenges and tragedies of human sociality. The social capacity is based on collaboration, and we as a species are extremely dependent on working together. Many findings from recent research are brought together in an overview of the evolution of our ancestors. One example of how seemingly irrelevant findings can assist in figuring out details of our history is the evolution of a species of lice that requires clothing to thrive, genetically estimated to have occurred at about 70,000 years ago, gives an indication of the latest date when clothing became ubiquitous.<br/><br/>An important theme is the fact that evolution cannot produce clean-cut solutions to many conflicts or discrepancies between possible strategies for survival. Very often, almost always, some strategies become dominant, others recede in importance, but are often still stably present, as the ecological situation for a species change. There are complex feedback loops, where a particular evolutionary invention causes new challenges. So it was with human sociality. It solved a problem, and produced many new ones at the same time.<br/><br/>The book narrates the story from the Oldowan stone tools made and used by Homo habilis about three million years ago, via the more advanced Acheulian stone tools made by Homo erectus one million years later, to Homo sapiens about 300,000 years ago. The themes include fire, migration, farming, theory of mind for social learning, cities, hierarchies, and many more. An important point is that although we may be considered the ultimate innovator of the animal kingdom, it is sufficient if only very few people actually make new innovations. Our cumulative culture, where new, useful innovations can spread and be transmitted from generation to generation. The people doing the transmitting may not even be aware that they are selecting the best innovations, it's just part of the logic of evolution that this can happen if the circumstances allow it.<br/><br/>There are too many themes discussed in the book to bring up here. However, although culture is discussed, the interplay between sociality, culture and norms could have been more deeply analysed. A number of interesting examples are presented, but a rounded discussion is lacking.<br/><br/>The final part of the book discusses happiness, and proposes that evolution didn't design us to be happy, but rather to wish to be happy, and occasionally achieving it for short time. If we were too happy, we would just lie about and do nothing, thereby not procreating or surviving in sufficient numbers. It's a provoking thought which in itself makes it worth reading this book.",,,1,0

His new book is short and written with admirable clarity. He marshals both empirical and philosophical evidence to support his hypothesis on the evolution of agency in animals. Agency is the active approach that higher animals take to the problem of surviving. The paradigm of stimulus/response that is sometimes used to analyse this activity is hopelessly inadequate, in Tomasello's view. He posits a number of stages in the evolution of agency, where humans have reached the stage of socially normative agents, in which culture and norms are an essential part of our ecological niche.<br/><br/>A basic building block for all kinds of agency is the feedback control model. The organism has goals, and it monitors the environment and its own actions to improve the attainment of those goals. The basic driving force for the evolution of higher levels of agency was the increase in uncertainty in the environment due to competition and predation from other animals. A kind of arms race ensued. With each stage in the evolution of agency, another level of control is added at a higher level.<br/><br/>The first stage of agency involved flexible, context-sensitive behavior and learning, and involves attention to goal-relevant situations. The early vertebrates, modeled by current lizards, are hypothesized to have this level of goal-directed agency.<br/><br/>The next level, intentional agents, was probably reached by ancients mammals, corresponding to modern squirrels and rats. Due to increased competition with other goal-driven animals (including its own species and group), the ability to form a plan, an intention, evolved. This meant a degree of control of the lower-level goal-oriented behavior, adding more room for learning. An executive tier of decision-making and cognitive control was the means.<br/><br/>The third level reached by the ancient apes, probably similar to today's chimpanzees, was that of rational agents. By comparing plans and simulating in the mind various alternative actions, apes could begin to act logically and reflectively. The benefit to the individual was to understand how and why other individuals (conspecifics) acted as they did, and to anticipate their future moves. This required another executive tier, the reflective tier, which made it possible for apes to attribute mental states to others. An understanding of causality was also part of this development.<br/><br/>And finally, the fourth stage, ancient humans. Here new levels of social interaction, collaboration and competition became the driving force for development of joint agency in collaboration. Two persons agreeing to act together in a task, entailing commitment and role-taking. The collaboration of humans became obligate, i.e. it became a necessary mode of life. The selection for cooperatively competent and motivated individuals became very strong. Self-regulation in this social collaborative environment became essential, and the urge to make others conform developed as a response. Norms were born. Another level of executive control was added to regulate joint agency.<br/><br/>Culture, morality and collective agency thus evolved out of the need for better collaboration. ""Human social relationships in general ... derive from the fundamentally cooperative nature of human social relationships."" Once culture became important, it drove evolution by making cultural groups into coherent units of natural selection. Modern cultural groups have become collective agencies. This in turn explains the very strong in-group/out-group psychology of humans.<br/><br/>The need to look out for our individual interests, at the same time as we want to collaborate with others, is the fundamental reason why we humans experience true moral conflicts. We inhabit an objective-normative world, where norms are human creations, and yet have objective existence.<br/><br/>I find Michael Tomasello's hypothesis to be bold and extremely interesting. It makes sense of, and puts into perspective, the importance that norms and culture have for humans. The role of evolutionary thinking in social, political and ethical thinking is clearly growing.",,,1,0

One important point is that the expansion took place in distinct pushes, historically brief, with long periods of little change in between.<br/><br/>The narrative focuses perhaps a little too much on the historical ideas and prejudices in the development of the sciences involved, but given the strong influence of racist ideas in interpreting the facts, it is understandable. The book is amply illustrated with many historical renderings, and though the maps are very useful, I do miss a schematic map showing the approximate geographical and temporal paths of the expansion.

It is organized as an investigation of what the author Gerald Gaus calls Friedrich Hayek's three unsettling theses: 1) That human nature has a tribal and parochial egalitarian basis which fundamentally is in conflict with the Open Society, and must be kept in check by it. 2) The Open Society is too complex to be amenable to justification, i.e. rational analysis and criticism. 3) The complexity of the Open Society is such that conscious human control and governance is impossible. At most, the state can provide the framework for the openness of the Open Society. Basically, the project that Gaus embarks on is to make a more optimistic case for the Open Society by critically discussing, and to some extent refuting Hayek's theses.<br/><br/>Gaus' argument concerning Hayek's first thesis takes into account the advances in understanding of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens that has taken place during the last 30 or so years. He notes that the idea that morality has sprung out of the needs of the hypersocial human animal during its evolution has become commonplace. In Gaus' view, political philosophy must now be discussed with explicit reference to human nature as nowadays understood in an evolutionary context. This includes the fact that humans are a fundamentally cultural species, which has many important ramifications. Gaus argues that human sociality is based on cooperation and that there are strong forces in it that drive towards inclusion, impartiality and self-organization which Hayek did not take into account, and which undermine Hayek's first thesis that human nature is at odds with the Open Society.<br/><br/>Gaus' argument on the second and third of Hayek's theses uses a range of arguments from different fields. It is a complex text, which is hard to summarize. It has many interesting threads, and requires much thinking on the part of the reader. The upshot is that Hayek did have many valid points, but that there is actually considerable space for both critical evaluation of society, and for attempts at reforming it consciously.<br/><br/>Although Gaus uses the term Open Society, which Karl Popper made famous, his account is almost wholly based on Hayek's evolutionary view of a free society - what Hayek called the Great Society. Although he refers to Popper in some passages, he is clear that he considers Hayek's analysis superior to Popper's. But, somewhat strangely, Gaus ends up in a position which is more similar to Popper's; he does not use the term, but he views social engineering - which Popper argued for - in a more positive light than Hayek. Now, it is clear that Popper did not flesh out his analysis of the Open Society very much; Gaus does a lot more work in this regard. But still, some discussion about the fact that Gaus' position ends up closer to Popper than to Hayek would have been useful.<br/><br/>The text is dense, and it draws on arguments from a broad range of scientific fields, such as anthropoly, primatology, psychology, cultural studies of various kinds, economics, game theory and complexity theory. This makes the book rather hard to read, even though the language in itself is not that difficult. There is just so much in it! Some issues are investigated through formalized analysis, which occasionally provides more clarity, in others not. This book cannot be recommended to the average politically interested person. Someone else needs to write a popular version of Gaus' account.<br/><br/>In these days, when the Open Society is threatened from many directions, it is somewhat startling to read the end of Gaus' text, where he is confident about the future: ""For a time, opponents of diversity and openness may check exploration, creativity, diversity, and freedom, but the forces propelling the new civilization proclaimed by Popper and Hayek cannot long be contained."" It should be noted that Popper did not take this for granted at all. One may hope that Gaus' optimistic conclusion will turn out to be well-founded.<br/>",,,1,0

Many of the problems are related to the unintentional effects of policies that have been called liberal, sometimes accurately, sometimes not. Fukuyama defines liberalism as arguing ""for the limitation of the powers of government through law and ultimately constitutions, creating institutions protecting the rights of individuals..."" Fukuyama criticizes neoliberalism as an economic liberalism that has increased inequality and directly or indirectly caused many of the issues besetting liberalism today. He points out that the threats to liberal democracy comes in different ways from both the left and the right.<br/><br/>Fukuyama discusses the issues of equality, dignity, individualism, diversity and pluralism, and the ways these simultaneously reinforce and conflict with one another. He is refreshingly candid about the difficulties involved in maintaining a society that balances these values. He is scathing about the neoconservatism of Patrick Deneen, Yoram Hazony and others. He expertly analyses the various aspects of identity politics. His comments on post-modern thinking by Michel Foucault and others illuminates the connections with both sides of the current so-called culture wars. The discussion of national identity acknowledges the dangers of nationalism but also recognizes that ""national identity is a social construct, and it can be shaped to support rather than undermine liberal values."" He thinks liberals should be more proud of national identity when it refers to an open society.<br/><br/>His conclusions for a defense of a liberal society include stating a number of liberal principles, which I do not discuss here; that would require at least an entire essay. The final word in Fukyama's book goes to the value of moderation, a value espoused by the ancient Greeks, among others. The quest for the totality of some value in politics may be most fundamental error of our age.",,,1,0

Cecilia Heyes argues that culture is much more important in the formation, maintenance and transfer of these features than typically assumed.<br/><br/>I am in general sympathetic to Heyes thesis. Culture is a absolutely essential aspect of what it is to be human, and any account that does not contain that realization is severely flawed. But the arguments made in this book do not quite convince me. They are interesting and worth discussing, and she does make a number of good critical points about competing theories, such as Noam Chomsky's account of language. But I close the book with a feeling of not having gotten a very good idea of how the cognitive gadgets actually work, in part because I wish there had been a more concrete discussion of a few examples. To be sure, she discusses several examples, such as language, but somehow these discussions are on a level of abstraction that does not quite hit home. Somehow, I am left unsatisfied.",,,1,0

Raymond Geuss has a number of, in my mind, valid points about the inherent problems with attempting to base morality and political theory on a small set (ideally one single) value or principle. Human social relations are so complex that claiming that e.g. ""justice as fairness"" can somehow be designated as the first virtue of social institutions (Rawls), or that simply stating as axiomatic the idea that ""individuals have rights"" (Nozick), cannot possibly capture all that is important or interesting about human social existence.<br/><br/>Geuss delivers some pretty drastic statements, and acknowledges that his task in this text is purely negative, i.e. critical. He does not present any political theory of his own. That is fine, except that I think his arguments are actually too strong because of this. They preclude many other possible political theories that are not as conceptually simple as Rawls or Nozick, and I think this is a mistake. Inherent in his approach is the idea that all morality is historically contingent, and I believe this is a mistake. There are many moral ideas that can be found among virtually all human societies, albeit in various constellations and combinations. Although the social morality may not be as simple as Nozick or Rawls presumes, neither may it be so arbitrary as Geuss seems to think.",,,1,0

Or do they start helping each other, sharing and caring? Rebecca Solnit documents in a journalistic fashion what happened after disasters such as the earthquake in San Francisco 1906, the earthquake in Mexico City 1985, the terrorist attack destroying the Twin Towers in New York 2001, the hurricane Katrina inundating New Orleans 2005, and several others.<br/><br/>Talking to many people involved in these events, she reports that the dominant reaction was to help each other out. The Hobbesian idea that people turn violent in such conditions is simply not borne out. In fact, more often than not, people came together to form impromptu organizations to help each other and others. And many say afterwards that these disasters brought out the best in them, and that their efforts were intensely meaningful and gratifying.<br/><br/>The problem with Solnit's text is that it is messy, especially the first third. It's eminently readable, that is not the problem. She mixes commentary, analysis and conclusions with here description of events in a way that makes it clear that she has a very definite approach, and that she wishes to make a point. I do not really have a problem with her making points, but I do have the nagging worry that her zeal makes her description of events skewed. Does she skip over those events that do not fit her ideas? This concern of mine pulls down my rating of the book.<br/><br/>Her critique of the Hobbesian view is explicit; she thinks it is downright false. The cases where violence occurred she attributes to so-called ""elite panic"", where authorities (military, police) in acted as if the stricken public were its enemies. She exemplifies with the killing of so-called looters, which most often were people simply trying to find food, water and materials to make shelter. But Solnit also reports on the white vigilantes in New Orleans who likely killed many black people when they were simply trying to pass through the ""wrong"" neighborhood. Now, to me this sounds like Hobbes. But Solnit does not make that connection.<br/><br/>Solnit views this pattern of helping each other in times of crisis as a glimpse of what society could be. She views current everyday life as a low-key permanent disaster, a kind of wet blanket smothering us, which is ripped away when a natural disaster strikes. In such circumstances we become who we really are; social, caring, egalitarian. In her analysis she refers to anarchist political philosophy, but her discussion does not go very deep. In particular, she does not try to answer the question why these spontaneous self-help and altruistic societies revert back to ""normal life"". Why are they not sustainable? Simply saying that this is the elite in action does not really answer the question: Why and how are these elites able to reassert their power?<br/><br/>Thus, her analysis is shallow. It basically just says that these societies are inspirations for another way of life. That is not enough. Although reading her book is worth while, it is also ultimately unsatisfying.",,,1,0

Han granskar frågan om språkets utveckling ur evolutionärt perspektiv, och försöker finna ledtrådar i jämförelsen med chimpanserna som är våra närmaste släktingar. Han söker också ledtrådar i bland annat arkeologi, paleontologi och egenskaper hos språk och andra kommunikationssystem bland djuren.

Liksom författaren har jag svårt att se hur man kan betrakta språket som sprunget ur en enda mutation eller motsvarande språngvis förändring av människan eller någon av dess föregångare. Evolutionen av en såpass komplex och social förmåga som språk måste bygga på komplexa och därmed gradvisa förändringar, där människans sociala och kulturella förmågor måste tas hänsyn till.

As part of laying out his own arguments and hypotheses, Sterelny nicely reviews the currently known facts about the evolution of hominims since 7 million years ago, and comments on uncertainties and controversies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his text is so condensed that he sometimes just assumes that the reader has background knowledge of some examples and debates he mentions. For example, he mentions the interesting anthropological case of the conflict between the Nuer and Dinka peoples, but does not explain the background. This makes the text unsuitable for newcomers to the field.<br/><br/>From this and other texts I have read recently, it is clear that the sparseness of hard data points makes it practically impossible to produce solid hypotheses about the mechanisms that drove the evolution of cooperation and cumulative culture. <br/><br/>Discussing several controversies in this area, Sterelny argues that the effects of group selection may have played some role, but that several other recent contributions to the field have oversold the case. Sterelny offers a nuanced alternative which builds a case for the evolution of cooperation, culture and tribal sociality built mainly on traditional notions of individual selection. I believe his arguments are basically valid, although not flawless.<br/><br/>One of his main points is that the mobile hunter/gatherer mode of life was one of fundamental equality between people, at least within the sexes. It was the gradual shift to farming that created societies with high levels of inequality. But importantly, more sedentary hunter/gatherers in the anthropological record also show examples of pronounced inequality. Sterelny provides a set of scenarios explaining the possible mechanisms of the growth of inequality, which in my mind seem eminently plausible.<br/><br/>In the last section of the book, Sterelny concludes that the problem of cooperation and culture is basically one of how the initial establishment of cooperation occurred. He thinks that once a basic mode of cooperation was achieved, the benefits of it were so great that it becomes easier to explain how the positive feedback loops could maintain this cooperation, and allow further evolution. Maybe. I am more impressed by the conditionality of it all. There were so many things that had to come together to create Homo sapiens. Our existence is a stochastic phenomenon.",,,2,0

The main theme is that humans self-domesticated to become the cooperative, social and cultural species that we are today. But even if we are much more friendly towards strangers than most other species, we have a strong tendency to classify people in ""us"" and ""them"", and this underlies a lot of the problems in human society.<br/><br/>This book is unusual in the genre in that it discusses explicitly some political aspects of the results in this field. However, it does so without reference to the main strands of political philosophy (except for a brief discussion of constitutional government). This is a problem, and makes the analysis weaker than it could be. However, it does try to provide ideas for positive action, and argues for creating arenas for interactions between foes as a means of creating greater understanding and, eventually, concrete friendships between persons, leading to peaceful co-existence. Segregation in various forms is not the way forward.",,,1,0

The writing is lucid, albeit a little too often rehashing the same points several times.<br/><br/>Starting with a morality based on reciprocity and cooperation in groups, the idea is that morality can expand from in-group/out-group thinking to include others as well, if certain conditions hold. The authors consider different examples and kinds of moral progress, but concentrate on the inclusion of additional moral agents, such as the argument of the 19th century abolitionists working against slavery that Africans have moral standing. The book uses human rights thinking as the main example.<br/><br/>The authors argue against what they call the evoconservative position: that humans are incorrigibly group-centered and that any attempts to greater inclusivity is an aberration which cannot be sustained. Importantly, the authors make the case that human moral psychology must be viewed in the light of the concept of plasticity, i.e. that the humans (and other organisms) have a range of possible behaviors which are activated depending on the concrete environment they encounter. If humans live in an environment of strife and strong competition, then in-group/out-group thinking becomes more dominant. When conditions favor cooperation and win-win scenarios, moral psychology can become more inclusive. Moral progress has a material, or naturalistic, foundation.<br/><br/>There are a few confusing points. In some places, the authors seem to argue that progress in moral thinking, e.g. arguments and debates about consistency in moral views, are insufficient to explain moral progress in general. Other times, the authors seem to suggest that it is exactly these debates that are being made possible by social developments. They say that their view is biological and naturalistic, and criticize cultural evolution as a concept. But if the logical content of moral argument has any force at all, then there must be cultural innovation and evolution, it seems to me.  <br/><br/>One of the most interesting points of the book is that moral progress must entail epistemic humility. We should not try to formulate the ultimate morality, since we cannot know what innovations in morality might happen in the future. If we look back in history, there are many cases of social features that were considered moral, or non-moral, which we have now completely re-evaluated. Examples of features that have undergone fundamental changes in moral reasoning include slavery, dueling, sexual minorities, and the roles of men and women. We cannot presume to know what changes may occur in the future, so instead of trying to formulate the ultimate good, we should focus on improving morality, both the views of morality and its implementation.",,,1,0

It assumes quite some previous knowledge about political philosophy on the part of the reader, and it occasionally formalizes its arguments that perhaps makes them more strict, but also harder to follow.<br/><br/>That said, its investigation and critique of ""ideal theory"", the notion that political and moral philosophy should attempt to find a blueprint or a set of criteria for a just society, is convincing. The main target of criticism is John Rawls and his theory about Justice as Fairness. Starting from an argument by Amartya Sen, Gaus claims that an ideal theory must contain some kind of orientation aspect, i.e. a statement on in which direction, so to speak, a just society lies. This statement must be something other than just saying that we given our starting state should move to the next available better state. Gaus argues that any ideal theory faces what he calls ""The Choice"", that is, there must be occasions where the ideal theory concludes that we should *not* move to the next available better state, because that would bring us further from the ideal state that is has previously identified. Gaus doesn't say so, but this actually boils down to the statement by Lenin that one must break eggs to make an omelet. Which highlights the problem with ""The Choice"".<br/><br/>Gaus goes on to argue that ideal theory has an additional difficult problem if the state that it identifies as ideal is very different from anything we know. If there is something that has been learnt over the last 200 years or so, it is that attempts at achieving some perfect ideal society inevitably goes wrong.<br/><br/>Gaus discusses the problems with the Open Society, drawing on arguments by Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek, among others. He states that we should welcome the different views on justice that an Open Society brings. Different perspectives can search, share, debate and dismiss each other's insights while engaging in cooperative social relations. My concern here is the difficulty in maintaining those cooperative social relations. The last 10 years or so have seen an erosion in social relations in several Western democracies. This book, written before 2016, is, I fear, a little too optimistic.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are many interesting arguments in this book, but it does not really add up to a standalone philosophy. His critique of political philosophy in general is at times ascerbic, but I must say I agree with him. Maybe Gerald Gaus last book, The Open Society and Its Complexities, will bring more to the table. I will read it next.",,,1,0

And yet Plato, Socrates's admirer, chose to write philosophy. Why?<br/><br/>Allen proposes that Plato realized he needed to reach more people to effect the political changes he wanted. This could only be done by writing, and writing effectively, through crafting concepts, images and messages that were pragmatically efficient at transmitting the underlying ideas. Plato's excuse for using writing in spite of Socrates stance is basically that writing is a form of the noble lie, a statement that is not true, but still gets the job done. Plato was the western world's first message man, giving the politicians after him ready-made sound-bites.<br/><br/>I find Allen's approach intriguing, although a bit thin as regards the evidence for some hypotheses. The sources are few; much that surely would have been relevant has been lost in the mists of time. Allen makes good use of what there is.<br/><br/>It is somewhat interesting that Allen dismisses Popper's analysis of Plato as a totalitarian in a single sentence. I would like to ask Allen in what way her analysis conflicts with that of Popper. In my view, they are wholly compatible.",,,1,0

He argues against what he calls Veneer Theory, the view that morality in humans is just a thin layer on top of an amoral core. Instead, morality, or at least its fundamental building blocks, can be found in social mammals, and in particular in primates such as the chimpanzee. He posits that morality evolved, and evolution does not do discontinuities (saltatory changes). So the development must have been gradual. His views are discussed by the philosophers Robert Wright, Christine M Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer.<br/><br/>I believe de Waals has a number of valid points, and describes his own and other's findings very well. However, he is rightly criticized by Kitcher and Singer that he is vague when he claims that the ""building blocks"" of morality are there in chimpanzees, and therefore, by evolutionary extension, also in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. That concept seems to hide more than it reveals.<br/><br/>The basic issue here, I think, is the emergent nature of morality. Emergence is a tricky concept: it says that something new can spring out of something that already exists, given certain context and conditions. But it may also say that this new thing has some kind of beginning, a proto-existence, in the preceding state. And this new thing, when it has come into existence, can be viewed as something ""higher up"". It is based on what is below, but can also affect what is below. The terms often used, such as ""based on"", being ""the core of"" ""the foundation of"" and similar have a hard time conveying this sense that the emergent property can be both a function of, but also affect, the basis of its existence.<br/><br/>Morality is such an emergent property. It is based on psychological propensities common to humans and higher animals such as chimpanzees, but its reliance in humans on culture makes it different from what exists in chimpanzees. So although de Waal has a point that Veneer Theory is a bad way of describing morality, he too lightly skips over the large differences that culture and language produce when combined with the psychological common traits of humans and chimpanzees. In general, de Waal underplays the importance of culture in humans. Both Peter Singer and Philip Kitcher have valid critical points here.",,,1,0

Gellner posits three main stages of society: hunter/gatherer, agriculture and industry. He argues that the nature of cognition, production and coercion (power) is quite different in each stage. The development of an industrial society based on industry was a singular event, since agriculture, from which it arose, is inherently conservative and stable. Very particular circumstances had to occur simultaneously for a rational, enlightened, liberal society to emerge.<br/><br/>Some observations and analyses are convincing, others not quite. A major issue is the pervasive lack of concrete examples. For instance, Gellner discusses at length the ""many-strandedness"" of cognition in hunter/gatherer and agricultural society, and contrasts it with the ""single-strandedness"" characteristic of rational thought. But he gives few, if any, concrete examples of what this many-strandedness consist of.<br/><br/>As to the writing, it is clear and reasonably straightforward, but with an annoying habit of being indirect. Instead of being explicit that some argument or observation is about, say, the French Revolution, Gellner wraps it up in indirect descriptions, assuming that the reader can figure it out for himself. Elegant, perhaps. But also intellectually arrogant.",,,1,0

Olofsson och Örestig beskriver ett antal forskningfält där det evolutionsbiologiska perspektivet har använts. De vill inte övertyga om någon specifik teori om människans natur, utan refererar debatten. Det är både en styrka och en svaghet.<br/><br/>För den intresserade ges många goda tips för att gå vidare i litteraturen för de olika fälten, även om litteraturlistan är en blandning av såväl primära källor (forskningsartiklar), såväl som sammanfattningar. Jag hade uppskattat litet tydligare hänvisningar till vilka texter man bör läsa om man vill fordjupa sig inom något av fälten.<br/><br/>I vissa delar är det oklart vad de refererade forskningsresultaten egentligen har för relevans, som exempelvis diskussionen av hjärnans funktion.

Ett avsnitt om epigenetik är tydligt påverkat av den tidens (ca 2014) populära överdrifter om den forskningens resultat och konsekvenser.<br/><br/>Det bästa kapitlet handlar om välfärdsstatens evolution där frågan om samevolutionen mellan kultur och samarbetsförmåga diskuteras. Samma avsnitt innehåller dessvärre också det svagaste avsnittet, det om välfärdsstatens utveckling som evolutionsprocess, vilket är alltför ytligt för att bli övertygande.<br/><br/>Boken är läsvärd. Jag lärde mig en hel del om diskussioner jag bara ytligt hört talas om.

It combines hard-headed reasoning with attention to detail, willingness to propose bold hypotheses, careful analysis of arguments, and honesty about points where the evidence is weak.<br/><br/>The primatologist Richard Wrangham posits that our ancestors became Homo sapiens by a process of simultaneous reduction of reactive aggression (response to attack and threat) and increase of proactive aggression (premeditated attack against others). The reduction of reactive aggression occurred in a process of self-domestication, while proactive aggression got its boost from a combination of language, the coalition of males against tyrannical alpha males, and inter-group conflict.<br/><br/>Wrangham explores the evolutionary basis for these changes compared to our latest common ancestors with great apes and also, as far as the evidence allows us to say anything, Neanderthals. His controversial explanation is what he calls the execution hypothesis. At some point maybe 300,000 years ago, our ancestors acquired the ability to form coalitions. The males in a group started collaborating to control and, in the ultimate case, execute any tyrannical alpha male. Over the generations, this reduced the propensity for reactive aggression. The new-found power of the male collective also led to the development of morals, shame, and guilt, as regulators of behavior as mechanisms for avoiding the potentially lethal disapproval of the group.<br/><br/>Wrangham is that kind of scientist and thinker who does not shirk from the idea that terrible mechanisms can yield good results. He displays palpable disdain for the Rousseauian idea that humans are naturally good, while civilisation has made us twisted and evil. But neither is he a fully committed Hobbesian; he thinks morality, altruism and cooperation are part of our nature, and not something an authority has to force us into.<br/><br/>In the final chapter of the book Wrangham writes: ""... evolution has left us with biases that affect our behavior in predictable and sometimes disturbing ways, and we would do well to acknowledge those biases."" It is my belief that modern political philosophers need to question their various assumptions about human nature, morality and society in the light of the evolutionary insights that Wrangham and many others have provided during the last 30 or so years.",,,1,0

Wilson arrives at the answer only after careful analysis, e.g. by making a distinction between altruism in action and altruism in thought. The book is based on the notion of group selection in evolution, a concept recently rehabilitated by, among others, the author himself. Group selection, or more generally, multi-level selection, can occur  under fairly well-defined circumstances, overriding or modifying ""ordinary"" individual selection. Rather than disproving the selfish gene theory, Wilson clarifies why and how that theory is not and cannot be the whole answer.<br/><br/>Wilson also ventures into the arena of politics and philosophy, which is a dangerous thing for biologists, and evolutionists in particular, to do. But he pulls it off admirably. The discussion centers around Elinor Ostrom's theory of how the tragedy of the commons can be avoided (a prime example of altruism in action), and the connection of this concept to evolutionary mechanisms is explored. An interesting and provocative observation is that altruism is actually a modern concept, and does not figure in the major religions, at least not under the definition used by Wilson.",,,1,0

He describes the development of the human child and its abilities from birth to 6 years of age, and contrasts it to the abilities of mainly chimpanzees. It is during this time that most, if not all, capabilities that makes humans human manifest themselves. It's a story of how the hypersocial nature of humans is made possible by evolutionary changes in various capabilities that in some form or another existed already in the last common ancestor of humans and great apes. These changes eventually produced a species for which accumulative culture, language, cooperation and reason are rooted in biology, but at the same time go far beyond biology. Tomasello calls this the ""shared intentionality theory"", since it relies heavily on the notion of shared intentionality, in which two or more individuals share a common goal and understanding in a situation, and they understand that the other understands this also. This develops into collective intentionality, which is essentially human culture. The text is dense, so this is not an easy read. But it is rewarding, inspiring and provocative.",,,1,0

It manages to explain a very complicated process of develpment of the embroy by focusing on the fundamental mechanisms. In particular it makes clear the fact that all forces working during development are in a certain sense local, that is, there is no overarching direction or plan. Every cell is doing what is natural for it at that specific place given its internal and external context.<br/><br/>A most important point that the book brings across is that the phrase ""gene X is responsible for feature Y"" is extremely misleading. It is a short-hand for the scientific statement that when one alters gene X, for example makes it non-functional, then feature Y of the embryo or the mature organism is in some way changed or dysfunctional. This does not mean that gene X contains all information required to produce Y. The genomes is *not* a blueprint of the organism, it is more like a recipe for how to produce the organism given a suitable environment, a recipe where many genes are involved in creating each feature of the organism.",,,1,0

It carefully describes from where differences between humans arise, and how genetic and environmental variation can play out in different ways. The main message is that genes provide a set of potentials, or propensities, for how the organism can develop depending on the environment. Sometimes the genes limit the possible panorama of outcomes very tightly, sometimes only slightly, and sometimes a small set of possible outcomes are available. Importantly, in the latter case, the effects of pure chance can become crucial: if a system is set up to allow a divergence in development - a fork in the road, as it were - then the final result cannot be said to be neither ""in"" the genes nor determined by the environment. And yet it is innate.<br/><br/>I have a minor quibble: In a few paragraphs, the language has a few too many bio-jargon terms, which ought to have been edited away.<br/><br/>In the last pages, Mitchell makes a brief visit in the philosophical mine-field of determinism. He states that his view does not undermine free will, but he rejects dualism (the view that brain and mind are different). But he also writes ""The mind is not a thing at all - at least, it is not an object. It is a process, or a set of processes - it is, simply put, the brain at work.""<br/><br/>This seems to me to beg the issue. When he continues to affirm that the logical content of a thought - its meaning - can have a casual power in and of itself, by being an emergent phenomenon, then he seems to me to be much more of a dualist than he wants to admit. Now, I have absolutely no problem with this at all. The notion that the content of thoughts can have a causal power seems to me to contradict material determinism. The dualism (or rather theory of Worlds 1, 2 and 3) that Karl Popper espoused in ""The Self and Its Brain"" (with John Eccles) is, in my mind (!), a highly fascinating attempt at solving the mind-body problem.",,,1,0

It is not a matter of applying pre-existing moral axioms - either god-given or rationally derived à la Kant - but rather a creative exercise in inventing new solutions to new problems. He calls this approach ethical naturalism. Johnson relies heavily in John Dewey and argues against Immanuel Kant, whose ethics he considers to be actually very similar to the religious fundamentalist's idea of morals as given by a commanding god, but minus the god. He says that in the same way that Kant tried to de-theologize Judeo-Christian ethics, so Rawls tries to de-transcendentalize Kant, removing Kant's claims of absolute foundations in pure practical reason, while keeping most of the rest of Kant's moral vision. He defends Dewey's idea of the ""qualitative unity of the situation"", but I fail to see what that position actually does. It seems to me that this particular line of argument makes the theory more prone to relativism than it needs to be.<br/><br/>Basically, Johnson considers the quest for ethical certainty in a small set of moral axioms to be fundamentally mistaken. Moral problem-solving is an empirical inquiry. He maintains that this does not lead inevitably to relativism. Criticism of moral ideals is possible, and we are not prisoners of our inherited moral frameworks. Progress is possible. In my mind, his approach fits very well with the evolutionary wave of thinking that is currently under way in the science and philosophy of human nature. Although he does not refer to Karl Popper or Michael Tomasello, I think there are clear points of contact in the approach.<br/><br/>I can recommend this text. It is well written, clear and forceful. Its provokative ideas made me think about ethics in a new way.",,,1,0

But, of course, having a despotic stat does not really solve the problem. Liberty cannot flourish in either a state of anarchy (Absent Leviathan) or a tyranny (Despotic Leviathan). What is required is a state whose powers are controlled by a strong civil society with democratic traditions, a Shackled Leviathan.<br/><br/>The Narrow Corridor of the title refers to the thin area in a diagram where the x- and y-axis denote the power of the state, and society, respectively. The part of the diagram where the state has overwhelming power is the Despotic Leviathan, where the state is weak is the Absent Leviathan, which often means a clan-based society.<br/><br/>I find the analysis convincing, in general. It is not so much a theory of society as a way to analyse what happened in particular cases. The requirements for a society to get into, and stay inside, the Narrow Corridor are always dependent on the particular historical circumstances. The authors tell stories about what happened in a number of cases, and although I cannot claim to be an expert, I cannot spot any direct and obvious misreadings of history.<br/><br/>The main take-home message I got from this book is the contingent nature of a state of liberty. Often, the liberal view seems to be that democracy and a free society are somehow natural, and other types of states and society are perversions. In contrast the view in this book is rather that a free, individualistic society is very much a special case, which requires hard work to reach and maintain. I believe this is correct.",,,1,0

First he debunks the popular postmodern myth that Enlightenment thinking was basically racist. Then he describes how a complex interplay of Romantic thought, pre-Darwinian notions and other influences created the overtly racist science of eugenics. Today, the postcolonial movement proposes ""respect"" for other cultures. Malik shows how this entails taking up some of the same arguments that were used to buttress older conservative and fascist ideas of race. It is a development that is as ironic as it is tragic.

The starting point is the propensity in chimpanzees for the collective in a flock to react and take action against an overbearing and severely abusive alpha male. The author argues that this propensity must have been present in the common ancestor to humans and chimpanzee. Add to this the egalitarian trends that followed (or preceded?) ancient humans developing a hunting strategy for larger prey. Such prey could be brought down only through collaboration, and the meat had to be divided in reasonably equal shares, or the group would not be able to maintain this strategy. An important step was the development of a conscience and of shame, which the author hypothesizes was the evolutionary result of the group's aversion to alpha-male bullying and free-riding. Being thrown out of the group, or killed outright, because the rest of the group got fed up with them, was a risk that put a severe selection pressure on strong and successful individuals to rein in their egoistical impulses. By anticipating and internalizing the judgement of the group, such individuals could pass on their genes. Altruism, primarily with the immediate next-of-kin but also with the rest of the group, would bestow a reputational benefit on individuals, thus enhancing their chance of passing on their genes. This argument depends on reputation being communicated, so language is required. This text does not discuss how language evolved, so there is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here. Did language evolve for this kind of communication (gossip), or, as Mercier and Sperber suggest, as a means of justifying an individuals actions? Possibly both, but reasonable scenarios remain to be provided.",,,1,0

She discusses both the evolutionary and mechanistic processes underlying our humanity. A nice read, with several important and sometimes provocative points delivered in a well-written text. Churchland begins with defining conscience as ""knowledge of the community standards"", and goes on to describe how such standards have been internalized in the human mind.<br/><br/>Science cannot tell us what is morally right, but it can probe why we are moral, and how that faculty is grounded in the biological reality of humans as social beings. The fact that humans are born helpless and require assistance by parents and others for many years is both a cause and effect of our hypersocial nature. Our cognitive flexibility presupposes a long learning period. We are clearly wired for cooperation in an extreme degree, and this requires norms and values. Fairness in sharing the results of collaboration is a basic human attitude.<br/><br/>Churchland criticizes the strong western tradition in moral philosophy of searching for strict universal rules as a basis for morality. As examples of such philosophy, she first dispatches of the religious attempt to build morality on the god(s); the Socratic dialogue Euthyphro invalidated that project. Next, she looks at the twin secular attempts at universal moral rules: Immanuel Kant, on the one hand, and the utilitarians, on the other, both attempting, in very different ways, to formulate a fundamental moral rule. One of her points (which reminds me of Isaiah Berlin's discussion about the plurality of values) is that moral choices must be viewed as acts of constraint satisfaction, where different values and considerations come into play depending on the circumstances, and that there is little reason to believe that a single principle could ever handle all possible situations. Social life is simply too complex.

The problem is that this positive view of humanity doesn't explain why we are also prone to forming oppressive societies and cultures, and why we wage war.

Since I have read several other books in this area recently, not much was new for me, but I think this is a good book for those who want an introduction. The writing is mostly fluid and easily read.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the book he poses the question why humans reached ""modernity"" (by which he means, I think, a material and artistic culture that produced artifacts) much later than Homo sapiens became clearly the same species as we are today. That is, why the lag time? His interesting suggestion is that it has to do with population size. Cultural transmission benefits hugely from a larger population size. Conversely, a too small population makes it very hard to maintain a certain cultural level. The standard example here is the Tasmanian indigenous culture, which after having been cut off from Australia, clearly regressed.<br/><br/>However, this suggestion somewhat begs the question. Why did the population increase? Could cultural advances have caused this, or was it just (?) due to external causes, such as climate change?<br/><br/>Minor quibble: Rutherford discusses rape as a phenomenon, and argues that although very similar behavior (i.e. violently enforced sex) can be seen in some other species, such as dolphins, those instances should not be called ""rape"" since that is a legal term.

Some parts are brilliant, other parts would have needed a more active  editor forcing the author to tighten up the argument.<br/><br/>By giving many examples from his own research and that of others, Frans de Waal convincingly argues that morality was founded from below, i.e. it began with goal-oriented behavior, via mother-child empathy and further to the constraints that successful collaboration implies in a social species. Our moral sense is not founded on rationality. Which is not to say that rationality cannot have a role in discussing and criticizing morality. The study of primarily chimpanzee and bonobos hints at the how the common ancestor of these species and Homo sapiens behaved, and brings a different light to the behavior of humans. He also weaves in other results from anthropology and the social sciences to show that human behavior has roots and counterparts among mammals and apes more often that is usually realized.<br/><br/>De Waal spends a lot of text attacking the so-called new atheists (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, et al) while at the same time actually agreeing to a lot of what they in fact say. He criticizes Harris for wanting to base morality on science, and distances himself from this view most strenuously, but at the same time bases his own view on morality to a large degree on what the science says. It seems his main bone of contention with the new atheists is that they are vocal and explicit in their critique of religion. His defense of religion is rather tepid; the absence of belief in a moralistic God would create a ""vacuum"", he contends. As with many intellectuals who use this argument, he himself is an atheist, so apparently that vacuum can't be too bad. He at the same time repeatedly states that morality preceded religion, and that the idea of a moralistic God is most likely a fairly recent phenomenon, at least in the evolutionary timescale.

Individen frodas i ett socialt och politiskt sammanhang där debatt och förnuft är centrala. Denna ingång, som polemiserar mot nidbilden att individualism är i grunden asocial, kombineras med tre värdebegrepp för individualismen: autenticitet, individualitet och singularitet.<br/><br/>Boken är i huvudsak klar och redig, och argumenterar ärligt. Men det finns vissa problem som härrör från dess bitvis onödigt filosofisk-tekniska terminologi. Ahlin Marceta vill hävda ett ""svagt politiskt ideal"". Den termen orsakar nog mer förvirring än klarhet även om den är oklanderlig ur akademisk filosofisk synvinkel.<br/><br/>Det finns mycket att gilla med denna boken. Det finns många intressanta idéer, teman och resonemang. Den gör klart att fri marknadsekonomi inte är grundbulten i liberalt tänkande, och den visar på stråk i den liberala idéhistorien som behöver komma i fokus igen.<br/><br/>Men den är inte helt sammanhängande, och dess koppling till politisk praktik är, trots goda ansatser, inte så tydlig. Den sitter litet på gärsgården mellan politisk ideologi och politisk filosofi. Dess analys av svensk socialdemokrati är litet tveksam, och frånvaron av diskussion om socialliberalism är litet överraskande.<br/><br/>Bokens resonemang om kultur, arbete och medborgarskap är mycket intressanta, och bär inom sig frön till framtida diskussioner. Detta är inte en färdig liberalism, utan ett inlägg som syftar till framtida debatt.",,,1,0

As these ideas and values have successively been influencing society, their unintended but necessary effects are the problems we face today: populism, alienation, commercialism, depletion of the environment, income inequality, etc. He makes the point that there is no easy way of fixing liberalism, since the causes of the problems are in the roots of liberalism itself. If there is one stylistic problem with the book, it is that he makes this point far too many times.<br/><br/>Although I think there is some merit to the argument that the current problems of liberalism are due to its fundamentals, Deneen does not seem to realize that his argument proves too much. He states that at least some liberal ideas stem from Christian thinking, but if that is the case, did not those original ideas also contain in themselves the same self-destructive potential that he attributes to liberalism? Is it perhaps so that those Christian thoughts also contained in themselves the seeds of secularism and of liberal developments? This is at any rate the thesis proposed by Larry Siedentop in his ""Inventing the Individual"", which I have reviewed briefly in this site. If Deneen had read Siedentop, he would have had a more difficult time portraying the emergence of liberalism as a fall from the communitarian Eden of previous times. Incidentally, it is hard to figure out when that Eden was supposed to have existed. Sometimes, Deneen seems to locate this Eden in the New England as described by Tocqueville, but at other times one gets the impression that he is talking about pre-renaissance times.<br/><br/>Towards the end of his book, Deneen does grudgingly accept that liberalism does represent some kind of advance. Although he is unable to say this without reiterating his withering contempt for liberalism, he is explicit that there can be no turning back. He has a very hard time proposing an alternative. He describes rather vaguely a so-called Benedictine option, a kind of low-key communitarian practical living that attempts to carve out a space outside of modern society. A community basing its life on organic tradition is to be achieved by explicit design. Deneen is conscious of the inherent contradiction of this proposal. So, the book is a failure, but an interesting one.",,,1,0

An interesting similarity is that superheroes aren't interesting unless they have a weak spot, like kryptonite for Superman.

It challenges the idea that Western liberalism was born during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Instead, Larry Siedentop maintains that the crucial ingredients are found in St Pauls invention of Christianity, in particular the idea that all humans are equal before God, combined with a modified rationalism from Greece and Rome. The struggle between and within church and state in the context of the dissolution of the Roman empire, and the interaction between ideas and society during the Middle Ages laid the essential groundwork for the idea of secularity, among other things. The main intellectual inventions required for liberalism were already in place before the Renaissance. Please note that the author does not maintain that liberalism requires faith in Christianity, only that it grew out of it. The writing is clear and straightforward. The only criticism I have is that the author hammers home his thesis a little too often. ",,,1,0

Zielonka drives home the thesis that liberals and liberalism to a large extent is to blame for these developments. Liberals cannot avoid looking critically at themselves. A reappraisal is required. I agree.<br/><br/>However, I do not agree with every aspect of Zielonka's analysis, but that is to be expected. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, his pointers towards a new liberalism are vague. The first step must be to realize that there is a problem. This book, and others, show that there is a global, or at least western, debate about these issues.

It gives a very good overview of the interplay of historical processes and ideological thought. For those liberal thinkers which I have deeper knowledge of, Fawcett is accurate and gives a fair summary of the main ideas.<br/><br/>The main problem I have is with style. His writing is sometimes rather staccato, one sentence following another without obvious connection. It makes it hard to follow the argument being made. In other places, the writing is much more fluent.<br/><br/>The final chapter offers some interesting thoughts on the future of liberalism and the challenges now that the era of ""the end of history"" (Fukuyama) of 1989-2008 (or whichever dates you wish to use) is over.

She attempts to write not only about the kings, consuls and emperors, but also about what is known about the lives and circumstances of citizens and slaves. It is a good read, and I recommend it. I learned a lot and gained a better perspective of events that I knew of since before. She writes in a more-or-less chronological fashion about the events up to Augustus, and after that in a more thematic way, and she gives good reasons for this approach.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that Beard, in a few cases, mentions certain events as if assuming that the reader already knows about them. To be sure, she often comes back to those events later in the text, and explains them more fully. But still, it makes for some mystification.<br/><br/>The other complaint concerns the discussion of the methodological problems about what we can now, given the fragmentary and biased evidence we have. I'm not entirely sure why, but the discussion left me a little unsatisfied. Maybe because it was too theoretical or vague, or that it bordered on the trivial? Anyway, this is a minor issue. The presentation of the concrete problems of the evidence for certain events is satisfactory, as far as I can tell.",,,1,0

It is currently common to assume that Nietzsche and Heidegger provide a radical criticism of modernity (liberalism, capitalism, Enlightenment) that can be used for ""leftist"" purposes. The author drives home the simple fact that their criticism is fundamentally reactionary, which is very naturally being used by current far-right ideologues such as Aleksandr Dugin. The book assumes too much familiarity on part of the reader with Nietzsche. The part about Heidegger is much better, and renders a plausible brief description of his ideas, and, importantly, the problem that is the driving force behind Heidegger's thinking. It is here that Heidegger's nazism becomes understandable. Beiner shows convincingly that there is no way to separate Heidegger's philosophy from his political ideas.",,,1,0

But of course one cannot cram all of humanity's history into 500 or so pages without problems. Oversimplification is bound to happen. His approach to condense the story into first a pre-history part and then a number of parts of thematic accounts works fairly well. I do not mind the author being opinionated, he is pretty straightforward about it.<br/><br/>His points about the scientific revolution being predicated on the realization that we are ignorant, and that empires are more than just evil ideas of the corrupt West (as many would have it), are provocative and interesting, in my mind.<br/><br/>My main complaints concern:<br/><br/>1) His view of culture being layered on top of biology, which seems to ignore the essential interrelatedness of culture and biology in the evolution of Homo.<br/><br/>2) His description of the development and relationships of cognitive, cooperative, moral and other features during Homo evolution are, I think, not quite coherent. The author makes clear that the raw data here is woefully inadequate, for obvious reasons, but I think there are some points here that do could be given a different interpretation.<br/><br/>3) his insistence on using the term ""imagination"" about social constructs such as status, knowledge and stories, which I think misses the point that such social constructs have a logic of their own, which makes them more ""real"" than just ""imaginative"". I think the term ""invented"" would have been better; once invented, the social constructs take on a life of their own.<br/><br/>4) His insistence that modern political ideologies are just religions in another form is unhelpful. It obscures the real differences for provocative ends. It does have a few points, but in general this is not a sharp analysis.<br/><br/>5) His characterization of Nazism as being a variant of evolutionary political thinking is so one-sided that it is practically false. It ignores completely the long prehistory of antisemitism in Christianity, the German nationalistic strands of thought that came out of the Romantic reaction the Enlightenment, and other aspects as well.",,,1,0

My appreciation of Hobhouse and Hobson was affected positively.

Her treatment also makes the point that liberal thought is not just a British and American affair, but that Germany, and in particular, France, was historically main arenas for liberal struggle against the monarchy, strong-man rule and the reactionary Catholic church. It is clear that Rosenblatt thinks this ""lost history"" of liberalism can provide much to further the debate, and I think she is right.

In order to argue for something, it is often a highly successful rhetorical strategy to portray it as natural. Why is that? One insight in Levinovitz' book is that ""natural"" is a religious term: ""'Nature' is another term for God; 'natural', a synonym for holy.""<br/><br/>Levinovitz takes a close look at several debates where the idea of what is ""natural"" is at the center. Some topics he investigates are: How to give birth (fun fact: the patron saint of childbirth is Raymond Nonnatus, literally ""not-born"", because cut from his dying mother's womb); the complications of vanilla; the conflicting views of the origin of mankind as the prototypical noble Savage or the nasty, brutish and short lives of the first humans; the contortions of the Catholic church in applying some version of ""naturalness"" for deciding which birth control techniques are permissible; and many others.<br/><br/>He is elegantly scathing when describing the ""consecrated consumption"" underpinning celebrity woo such as Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop line of products, and Deepak Chopra's involvement in high-priced condo schemes (""completely reinvent how we should all be living""). ""Nature"" priced at luxury rates exclusively for the elite.<br/><br/>He highlights the common conflation of ""natural"" with ""good"", but also acknowledges and is respectful of the deep need that humans have for finding good ways to live, and for confronting the challenges and questions of existence.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the book is that it uses the phrase ""the unnatural animal"" about humans, without investigating it further. Thus it misses out on what I believe is an important point. The ability, or rather the necessity, of humans to construct cultures as a way of living underlies many conflicts where the concept of ""naturalness"" is used as argument. The cultural patterns that one wishes to promote gain in credibility if they are seen as ""natural"", rather than developed by humans. And culture is unnatural in the sense that it would not exist if humans did not exist (barring a few proto-cultural examples among certain mammals), but it is also natural since Homo sapiens would not exist without it.<br/><br/>Levinovits ends with a conclusion that may be viewed as unsatisfying: compromise. Nature is wonderful, inspiring, and it can teach us a lot. But human actions and inventions to overcome nature are required for a better life.

The message is that liberals and conservatives (in the American sense) have different ""moral matrices"", i.e. value different aspects of human life and society differently. In one sentence: liberals are more concerned with care for individuals, while conservatives value the social fabric higher. Obviously, the argument in the book is more complex than this.<br/><br/>I have some reservations about the arguments concerning religion. The book's main argument is clearly focused on the situation in the US, but it does have considerable relevance to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I am myself a liberal, according to the book's classification. But I have lately seen more clearly the points of ""the other side"", and we are in real need of a discussion. Haidt is hopeful that it may be possible. Even if Trump is evidence to the contrary, maybe our current epoch may eventually prove Haidt right.",,,1,0

This book makes the case that that philosophy has not and cannot be killed off by science, which position I wholeheartedly agree with. The book is an analysis and interpretation of Plato's and Socrates' philosophies. The main problem I have with the account is that it is strongly and explicitly apolitical. Although the author does describe the political background, she does not draw any conclusions from the strong connection between Plato's ethics and politics, which connection I think is obvious. I am influenced in my thinking by Karl Popper's treatment of this question in his ""The Open Society and Its Enemies"", which is not discussed at all in the current book. One of the important points Popper makes is that one should discuss a philosopher's ideas in light of the problems that he/she was facing, and that this makes it much easier to interpret the arguments used. In contrast, Goldstein argues that the issue of how the positions were arrived at is secondary to the issue of whether they are valid or not, a statement that I think misses the point.",,,1,0

Det är alltför mycket en pyttipanna av insikter, hypoteser, åsikter och förslag. Det är alltför ofta osammanhängande och ambivalent. Exempelvis är diskussionen om så kallade medborgarförslag och medborgarmotioner dåligt strukturerad, bitvis repetitiv, och ibland direkt inkoherent.<br/><br/>Ett grundläggande problem är att bokens syfte är att motverka populismen, dvs Sverigedemokraterna. Men demokratins, och utredningens, syfte borde väl ytterst vara att åstadkomma ett samhälle som medborgarna vill ha? Den frågan präglar inte boken, vilket den borde.<br/><br/>Den rädsla som bokens titel hänsyftar på är den rädsla som sägs vara en viktig bevekelsegrund för SD:s väljare. Den rädsla som genomsyrar texten är snarare just risken att SD får något att säga till om. Ibland glimmar det till, och författarna visar att de kan förstå att många är besvikna på den liberala demokratins empiriska förmåga att leverera, men denna insikt utvecklas inte tillfredsställande. Det bestående intrycket är att betydelsen av SD, Brexit och Trump ännu inte tagit skruv ordentligt. Det är inte den liberala demokratins formalia som är problemet, utan dess substans, dess resultat, men kanske framförallt dess brist på resultat.",,,1,0
