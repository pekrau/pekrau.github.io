His new book is short and written with admirable clarity. He marshals both empirical and philosophical evidence to support his hypothesis on the evolution of agency in animals. Agency is the active approach that higher animals take to the problem of surviving. The paradigm of stimulus/response that is sometimes used to analyse this activity is hopelessly inadequate, in Tomasello's view. He posits a number of stages in the evolution of agency, where humans have reached the stage of socially normative agents, in which culture and norms are an essential part of our ecological niche.<br/><br/>A basic building block for all kinds of agency is the feedback control model. The organism has goals, and it monitors the environment and its own actions to improve the attainment of those goals. The basic driving force for the evolution of higher levels of agency was the increase in uncertainty in the environment due to competition and predation from other animals. A kind of arms race ensued. With each stage in the evolution of agency, another level of control is added at a higher level.<br/><br/>The first stage of agency involved flexible, context-sensitive behavior and learning, and involves attention to goal-relevant situations. The early vertebrates, modeled by current lizards, are hypothesized to have this level of goal-directed agency.<br/><br/>The next level, intentional agents, was probably reached by ancients mammals, corresponding to modern squirrels and rats. Due to increased competition with other goal-driven animals (including its own species and group), the ability to form a plan, an intention, evolved. This meant a degree of control of the lower-level goal-oriented behavior, adding more room for learning. An executive tier of decision-making and cognitive control was the means.<br/><br/>The third level reached by the ancient apes, probably similar to today's chimpanzees, was that of rational agents. By comparing plans and simulating in the mind various alternative actions, apes could begin to act logically and reflectively. The benefit to the individual was to understand how and why other individuals (conspecifics) acted as they did, and to anticipate their future moves. This required another executive tier, the reflective tier, which made it possible for apes to attribute mental states to others. An understanding of causality was also part of this development.<br/><br/>And finally, the fourth stage, ancient humans. Here new levels of social interaction, collaboration and competition became the driving force for development of joint agency in collaboration. Two persons agreeing to act together in a task, entailing commitment and role-taking. The collaboration of humans became obligate, i.e. it became a necessary mode of life. The selection for cooperatively competent and motivated individuals became very strong. Self-regulation in this social collaborative environment became essential, and the urge to make others conform developed as a response. Norms were born. Another level of executive control was added to regulate joint agency.<br/><br/>Culture, morality and collective agency thus evolved out of the need for better collaboration. ""Human social relationships in general ... derive from the fundamentally cooperative nature of human social relationships."" Once culture became important, it drove evolution by making cultural groups into coherent units of natural selection. Modern cultural groups have become collective agencies. This in turn explains the very strong in-group/out-group psychology of humans.<br/><br/>The need to look out for our individual interests, at the same time as we want to collaborate with others, is the fundamental reason why we humans experience true moral conflicts. We inhabit an objective-normative world, where norms are human creations, and yet have objective existence.<br/><br/>I find Michael Tomasello's hypothesis to be bold and extremely interesting. It makes sense of, and puts into perspective, the importance that norms and culture have for humans. The role of evolutionary thinking in social, political and ethical thinking is clearly growing.",,,1,0

It's a wonderful and fascinating story. In particular, the skills involved in navigating the deep sea using the stars and reading the signs of the ocean are humbling. The traditions and techniques developed by these expert seafarers were amazing, and happily there are now efforts to remember and revive the old ways.<br/><br/>The author Nicholas Thomas convincingly argues that the expansion of humans into Oceania could not have been primarily a random affair of shore-bound craft being blown off-course, or people being swept out on rafts by tsunamis. One important point is that the expansion took place in distinct pushes, historically brief, with long periods of little change in between.<br/><br/>The narrative focuses perhaps a little too much on the historical ideas and prejudices in the development of the sciences involved, but given the strong influence of racist ideas in interpreting the facts, it is understandable. The book is amply illustrated with many historical renderings, and though the maps are very useful, I do miss a schematic map showing the approximate geographical and temporal paths of the expansion. But it is nevertheless a book very well worth reading.",,,1,0

Är det inte litet förmätet att säga något kritiskt? Det uppenbara först: Charles Darwins teori om evolutionen är en av vetenskapens största framsteg. I boken samlar han ihop en mängd olika argument för den, och diskuterar dem med en kombination av skärpa och ödmjukhet. Han redovisar sådant som han anser utgör svåra problem för teorin. Men det är inte svårt att se varför, trots allt, så många av de som läste boken lät sig övertygas. Boken är inte alls den torra traktat som man skulle kunna föreställa sig, utan en levande och resonerande text.<br/><br/>Det som förvånade mig mest är hur mycket Darwin använder sig av observationer från husdjursavel i sin argumentation. Jag hade visserligen hört om hans avel av duvor, men att den aspekten används så mycket, och med sådan kraft, överraskade mig litet grann.<br/><br/>Med tanke på den centrala position som genetik och genomik har idag, så är Darwins diskussion om ärftlighetens mysterier ytterst frustrerande. Man vill skrika tvärs över de ca 170 år som gått sedan publikationen: GENER, Darwin, det handlar om GENER! Något liknande gäller hans diskussion om hur arter har spritts till olika världsdelar, där man så gärna vill berätta för honom om Wegeners kontinentaldriftsteori.<br/><br/>Detta sagt, över till min kritik. Bokens text innehåller en hel del repetititioner. Visst, det kan behövas i en argumenterande skrift. Men mitt intryck är att texten inte har redigerats riktigt så som borde ha skett. Det visade sig att Alfred Russel Wallace ungefär samtidigt oberoende hade kommit till samma insikter om evolutionens principer som Darwin. Detta tvingade Darwin att skriva boken, så är det förståeligt att det gick litet snabbt. Men jag tror boken hade blivit mycket bättre med en hård men rättvis redaktör.<br/><br/>Men den är, som sagt, en klassiker. Den bör läsas.",,,1,0

Nichola Raihani writes very well, and manages to explain scientific results and theoretical arguments in a very accessible manner. Beginning with cooperation on the level of genes, she goes on to explain how cooperation is the basis for multicellular life, continuing to cooperation between individual organisms. As part of the package, we get a very good description of how evolution works in general.<br/><br/>What I like most about her account is the emphasis that evolution does not prescribe one single solution to the problem of life. The slogan ""survival of the fittest"" is often taken to imply that ""fitness"" is simple and straightforward, and can therefore be achieved in only one way. This is not so. There are many ways of living, many possible strategies, and the context, including ecology, climate, genetics, and simple randomness, affect the outcome. Connected to this is also the important point made by Raihani that if we want to understand human sociality, it is not self-evident that we should look at our closest evolutionary relatives, such as the great apes. Rather, we should look at other species whose ecological and genetic context is similar in relevant aspects. The meerkats or the naked mole-rats have more in common regarding certain aspects of their social lives with humans, in spite of their more distant evolutionary relationships.<br/><br/>An important theme in the latter part of the book, where Raihani discusses how evolution has formed Homo sapiens, is the notion of social dilemmas. We are a profoundly social species, but being social implies its own built-in contradictions, such as the Tragedy of the commons, where the use of a common resource needs to be carefully managed, but each individual has an incentive to use it to the fullest, thereby collectively overusing it. How this problem can be solved is an important research topic with Elinor Ostrom as a central figure. This work is discussed by Raihani in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and the current climate crisis.<br/><br/>If there is one point of criticism, it would be her treatment of culture. The special role of cumulative culture, including norms, in human affairs is discussed by Raihani, but somehow I feel that she is not giving it the weight it should have in her discussion. Discussing hunter-gatherer societies, she seems to suggest that they were more similar than societies are today; this is, I think, wrong. Anthropological studies rather indicate the opposite. Hunter-gatherers were probably very culturally diverse. But this is a minor point in an otherwise highly readable book, which I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject.",,,1,0

It is organized as an investigation of what the author Gerald Gaus calls Friedrich Hayek's three unsettling theses: 1) That human nature has a tribal and parochial egalitarian basis which fundamentally is in conflict with the Open Society, and must be kept in check by it. 2) The Open Society is too complex to be amenable to justification, i.e. rational analysis and criticism. 3) The complexity of the Open Society is such that conscious human control and governance is impossible. At most, the state can provide the framework for the openness of the Open Society. Basically, the project that Gaus embarks on is to make a more optimistic case for the Open Society by critically discussing, and to some extent refuting Hayek's theses.<br/><br/>Gaus' argument concerning Hayek's first thesis takes into account the advances in understanding of the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens that has taken place during the last 30 or so years. He notes that the idea that morality has sprung out of the needs of the hypersocial human animal during its evolution has become commonplace. In Gaus' view, political philosophy must now be discussed with explicit reference to human nature as nowadays understood in an evolutionary context. This includes the fact that humans are a fundamentally cultural species, which has many important ramifications. Gaus argues that human sociality is based on cooperation and that there are strong forces in it that drive towards inclusion, impartiality and self-organization which Hayek did not take into account, and which undermine Hayek's first thesis that human nature is at odds with the Open Society.<br/><br/>Gaus' argument on the second and third of Hayek's theses uses a range of arguments from different fields. It is a complex text, which is hard to summarize. It has many interesting threads, and requires much thinking on the part of the reader. The upshot is that Hayek did have many valid points, but that there is actually considerable space for both critical evaluation of society, and for attempts at reforming it consciously.<br/><br/>Although Gaus uses the term Open Society, which Karl Popper made famous, his account is almost wholly based on Hayek's evolutionary view of a free society - what Hayek called the Great Society. Although he refers to Popper in some passages, he is clear that he considers Hayek's analysis superior to Popper's. But, somewhat strangely, Gaus ends up in a position which is more similar to Popper's; he does not use the term, but he views social engineering - which Popper argued for - in a more positive light than Hayek. Now, it is clear that Popper did not flesh out his analysis of the Open Society very much; Gaus does a lot more work in this regard. But still, some discussion about the fact that Gaus' position ends up closer to Popper than to Hayek would have been useful.<br/><br/>The text is dense, and it draws on arguments from a broad range of scientific fields, such as anthropoly, primatology, psychology, cultural studies of various kinds, economics, game theory and complexity theory. This makes the book rather hard to read, even though the language in itself is not that difficult. There is just so much in it! Some issues are investigated through formalized analysis, which occasionally provides more clarity, in others not. This book cannot be recommended to the average politically interested person. Someone else needs to write a popular version of Gaus' account.<br/><br/>In these days, when the Open Society is threatened from many directions, it is somewhat startling to read the end of Gaus' text, where he is confident about the future: ""For a time, opponents of diversity and openness may check exploration, creativity, diversity, and freedom, but the forces propelling the new civilization proclaimed by Popper and Hayek cannot long be contained."" It should be noted that Popper did not take this for granted at all. One may hope that Gaus' optimistic conclusion will turn out to be well-founded.<br/>",,,1,0

Many of the problems are related to the unintentional effects of policies that have been called liberal, sometimes accurately, sometimes not. Fukuyama defines liberalism as arguing ""for the limitation of the powers of government through law and ultimately constitutions, creating institutions protecting the rights of individuals..."" Fukuyama criticizes neoliberalism as an economic liberalism that has increased inequality and directly or indirectly caused many of the issues besetting liberalism today. He points out that the threats to liberal democracy comes in different ways from both the left and the right.<br/><br/>Fukuyama discusses the issues of equality, dignity, individualism, diversity and pluralism, and the ways these simultaneously reinforce and conflict with one another. He is refreshingly candid about the difficulties involved in maintaining a society that balances these values. He is scathing about the neoconservatism of Patrick Deneen, Yoram Hazony and others. He expertly analyses the various aspects of identity politics. His comments on post-modern thinking by Michel Foucault and others illuminates the connections with both sides of the current so-called culture wars. The discussion of national identity acknowledges the dangers of nationalism but also recognizes that ""national identity is a social construct, and it can be shaped to support rather than undermine liberal values."" He thinks liberals should be more proud of national identity when it refers to an open society.<br/><br/>His conclusions for a defense of a liberal society include stating a number of liberal principles, which I do not discuss here; that would require at least an entire essay. The final word in Fukyama's book goes to the value of moderation, a value espoused by the ancient Greeks, among others. The quest for the totality of some value in politics may be most fundamental error of our age.",,,1,0

Cecilia Heyes argues that culture is much more important in the formation, maintenance and transfer of these features than typically assumed.<br/><br/>I am in general sympathetic to Heyes thesis. Culture is a absolutely essential aspect of what it is to be human, and any account that does not contain that realization is severely flawed. But the arguments made in this book do not quite convince me. They are interesting and worth discussing, and she does make a number of good critical points about competing theories, such as Noam Chomsky's account of language. But I close the book with a feeling of not having gotten a very good idea of how the cognitive gadgets actually work, in part because I wish there had been a more concrete discussion of a few examples. To be sure, she discusses several examples, such as language, but somehow these discussions are on a level of abstraction that does not quite hit home. Somehow, I am left unsatisfied.",,,1,0

Raymond Geuss has a number of, in my mind, valid points about the inherent problems with attempting to base morality and political theory on a small set (ideally one single) value or principle. Human social relations are so complex that claiming that e.g. ""justice as fairness"" can somehow be designated as the first virtue of social institutions (Rawls), or that simply stating as axiomatic the idea that ""individuals have rights"" (Nozick), cannot possibly capture all that is important or interesting about human social existence.<br/><br/>Geuss delivers some pretty drastic statements, and acknowledges that his task in this text is purely negative, i.e. critical. He does not present any political theory of his own. That is fine, except that I think his arguments are actually too strong because of this. They preclude many other possible political theories that are not as conceptually simple as Rawls or Nozick, and I think this is a mistake. Inherent in his approach is the idea that all morality is historically contingent, and I believe this is a mistake. There are many moral ideas that can be found among virtually all human societies, albeit in various constellations and combinations. Although the social morality may not be as simple as Nozick or Rawls presumes, neither may it be so arbitrary as Geuss seems to think.",,,1,0

Or do they start helping each other, sharing and caring? Rebecca Solnit documents in a journalistic fashion what happened after disasters such as the earthquake in San Francisco 1906, the earthquake in Mexico City 1985, the terrorist attack destroying the Twin Towers in New York 2001, the hurricane Katrina inundating New Orleans 2005, and several others.<br/><br/>Talking to many people involved in these events, she reports that the dominant reaction was to help each other out. The Hobbesian idea that people turn violent in such conditions is simply not borne out. In fact, more often than not, people came together to form impromptu organizations to help each other and others. And many say afterwards that these disasters brought out the best in them, and that their efforts were intensely meaningful and gratifying.<br/><br/>The problem with Solnit's text is that it is messy, especially the first third. It's eminently readable, that is not the problem. She mixes commentary, analysis and conclusions with here description of events in a way that makes it clear that she has a very definite approach, and that she wishes to make a point. I do not really have a problem with her making points, but I do have the nagging worry that her zeal makes her description of events skewed. Does she skip over those events that do not fit her ideas? This concern of mine pulls down my rating of the book.<br/><br/>Her critique of the Hobbesian view is explicit; she thinks it is downright false. The cases where violence occurred she attributes to so-called ""elite panic"", where authorities (military, police) in acted as if the stricken public were its enemies. She exemplifies with the killing of so-called looters, which most often were people simply trying to find food, water and materials to make shelter. But Solnit also reports on the white vigilantes in New Orleans who likely killed many black people when they were simply trying to pass through the ""wrong"" neighborhood. Now, to me this sounds like Hobbes. But Solnit does not make that connection.<br/><br/>Solnit views this pattern of helping each other in times of crisis as a glimpse of what society could be. She views current everyday life as a low-key permanent disaster, a kind of wet blanket smothering us, which is ripped away when a natural disaster strikes. In such circumstances we become who we really are; social, caring, egalitarian. In her analysis she refers to anarchist political philosophy, but her discussion does not go very deep. In particular, she does not try to answer the question why these spontaneous self-help and altruistic societies revert back to ""normal life"". Why are they not sustainable? Simply saying that this is the elite in action does not really answer the question: Why and how are these elites able to reassert their power?<br/><br/>Thus, her analysis is shallow. It basically just says that these societies are inspirations for another way of life. That is not enough. Although reading her book is worth while, it is also ultimately unsatisfying.",,,1,0

In older literature, the role of cooperation between males in hunting and conflict has often been the focus. Here, the roles of different generations of women in the family and in human groups is described as a major force in the evolution, in some epochs being the main force. I find this aspect of the book to be both convincing and fascinating.<br/><br/>The book continuously stresses the importance of culture in our evolution. Human nature is to be cultural. Indeed, in the epilogue of the book, the authors go as far as saying that the idea of ""human nature"" should be abandoned, since culture has become so important for us that we with its help are active participants in the evolution of our behavior. I do not agree that the idea of ""human nature"" should be scrapped. I think the idea of ""human nature"" is still important, since without it we cannot explain e.g. why we are so hyper-cooperative as compared to all our closest evolutionary relatives.

As part of laying out his own arguments and hypotheses, Sterelny nicely reviews the currently known facts about the evolution of hominims since 7 million years ago, and comments on uncertainties and controversies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his text is so condensed that he sometimes just assumes that the reader has background knowledge of some examples and debates he mentions. For example, he mentions the interesting anthropological case of the conflict between the Nuer and Dinka peoples, but does not explain the background. This makes the text unsuitable for newcomers to the field.<br/><br/>From this and other texts I have read recently, it is clear that the sparseness of hard data points makes it practically impossible to produce solid hypotheses about the mechanisms that drove the evolution of cooperation and cumulative culture. <br/><br/>Discussing several controversies in this area, Sterelny argues that the effects of group selection may have played some role, but that several other recent contributions to the field have oversold the case. Sterelny offers a nuanced alternative which builds a case for the evolution of cooperation, culture and tribal sociality built mainly on traditional notions of individual selection. I believe his arguments are basically valid, although not flawless.<br/><br/>One of his main points is that the mobile hunter/gatherer mode of life was one of fundamental equality between people, at least within the sexes. It was the gradual shift to farming that created societies with high levels of inequality. But importantly, more sedentary hunter/gatherers in the anthropological record also show examples of pronounced inequality. Sterelny provides a set of scenarios explaining the possible mechanisms of the growth of inequality, which in my mind seem eminently plausible.<br/><br/>In the last section of the book, Sterelny concludes that the problem of cooperation and culture is basically one of how the initial establishment of cooperation occurred. He thinks that once a basic mode of cooperation was achieved, the benefits of it were so great that it becomes easier to explain how the positive feedback loops could maintain this cooperation, and allow further evolution. Maybe. I am more impressed by the conditionality of it all. There were so many things that had to come together to create Homo sapiens. Our existence is a stochastic phenomenon.",,,2,0

The writing is lucid, albeit a little too often rehashing the same points several times.<br/><br/>Starting with a morality based on reciprocity and cooperation in groups, the idea is that morality can expand from in-group/out-group thinking to include others as well, if certain conditions hold. The authors consider different examples and kinds of moral progress, but concentrate on the inclusion of additional moral agents, such as the argument of the 19th century abolitionists working against slavery that Africans have moral standing. The book uses human rights thinking as the main example.<br/><br/>The authors argue against what they call the evoconservative position: that humans are incorrigibly group-centered and that any attempts to greater inclusivity is an aberration which cannot be sustained. Importantly, the authors make the case that human moral psychology must be viewed in the light of the concept of plasticity, i.e. that the humans (and other organisms) have a range of possible behaviors which are activated depending on the concrete environment they encounter. If humans live in an environment of strife and strong competition, then in-group/out-group thinking becomes more dominant. When conditions favor cooperation and win-win scenarios, moral psychology can become more inclusive. Moral progress has a material, or naturalistic, foundation.<br/><br/>There are a few confusing points. In some places, the authors seem to argue that progress in moral thinking, e.g. arguments and debates about consistency in moral views, are insufficient to explain moral progress in general. Other times, the authors seem to suggest that it is exactly these debates that are being made possible by social developments. They say that their view is biological and naturalistic, and criticize cultural evolution as a concept. But if the logical content of moral argument has any force at all, then there must be cultural innovation and evolution, it seems to me.  <br/><br/>One of the most interesting points of the book is that moral progress must entail epistemic humility. We should not try to formulate the ultimate morality, since we cannot know what innovations in morality might happen in the future. If we look back in history, there are many cases of social features that were considered moral, or non-moral, which we have now completely re-evaluated. Examples of features that have undergone fundamental changes in moral reasoning include slavery, dueling, sexual minorities, and the roles of men and women. We cannot presume to know what changes may occur in the future, so instead of trying to formulate the ultimate good, we should focus on improving morality, both the views of morality and its implementation.",,,1,0

It assumes quite some previous knowledge about political philosophy on the part of the reader, and it occasionally formalizes its arguments that perhaps makes them more strict, but also harder to follow.<br/><br/>That said, its investigation and critique of ""ideal theory"", the notion that political and moral philosophy should attempt to find a blueprint or a set of criteria for a just society, is convincing. The main target of criticism is John Rawls and his theory about Justice as Fairness. Starting from an argument by Amartya Sen, Gaus claims that an ideal theory must contain some kind of orientation aspect, i.e. a statement on in which direction, so to speak, a just society lies. This statement must be something other than just saying that we given our starting state should move to the next available better state. Gaus argues that any ideal theory faces what he calls ""The Choice"", that is, there must be occasions where the ideal theory concludes that we should *not* move to the next available better state, because that would bring us further from the ideal state that is has previously identified. Gaus doesn't say so, but this actually boils down to the statement by Lenin that one must break eggs to make an omelet. Which highlights the problem with ""The Choice"".<br/><br/>Gaus goes on to argue that ideal theory has an additional difficult problem if the state that it identifies as ideal is very different from anything we know. If there is something that has been learnt over the last 200 years or so, it is that attempts at achieving some perfect ideal society inevitably goes wrong.<br/><br/>Gaus discusses the problems with the Open Society, drawing on arguments by Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek, among others. He states that we should welcome the different views on justice that an Open Society brings. Different perspectives can search, share, debate and dismiss each other's insights while engaging in cooperative social relations. My concern here is the difficulty in maintaining those cooperative social relations. The last 10 years or so have seen an erosion in social relations in several Western democracies. This book, written before 2016, is, I fear, a little too optimistic.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are many interesting arguments in this book, but it does not really add up to a standalone philosophy. His critique of political philosophy in general is at times ascerbic, but I must say I agree with him.

And yet Plato, Socrates's admirer, chose to write philosophy. Why?<br/><br/>Allen proposes that Plato realized he needed to reach more people to effect the political changes he wanted. This could only be done by writing, and writing effectively, through crafting concepts, images and messages that were pragmatically efficient at transmitting the underlying ideas. Plato's excuse for using writing in spite of Socrates stance is basically that writing is a form of the noble lie, a statement that is not true, but still gets the job done. Plato was the western world's first message man, giving the politicians after him ready-made sound-bites.<br/><br/>I find Allen's approach intriguing, although a bit thin as regards the evidence for some hypotheses. The sources are few; much that surely would have been relevant has been lost in the mists of time. Allen makes good use of what there is.<br/><br/>It is somewhat interesting that Allen dismisses Popper's analysis of Plato as a totalitarian in a single sentence. I would like to ask Allen in what way her analysis conflicts with that of Popper. In my view, they are wholly compatible.",,,1,0

This policy frowned upon incest, and gradually became more and more restrictive concerning how closely related the prospective spouses were allowed to be. This slowly broke down the clan-oriented social system, which led to the rise of other types of social organization, such as self-governing towns and guilds. And this in turn led to meritocracy and further on to the ideas of the rights of individuals.<br/><br/>The interplay between policy, material conditions, and the evolutionary developments of social systems is one of the most important themes of this book. There is no single factor or driving force behind historical developments. The dichotomy between materials and idealist views of history is implicitly  repudiated; it is a matter of true interplay, with feedback between different processes.<br/><br/>This is a dense book, requiring careful reading. (The reason it took so long for me to finish is, however, mostly of a personal context.) It is well-argued, and I think it drives home its main point in a persuasive way. It will be interesting to see the future discussion: It is clear that the roots of Western ideas of individualism, secularism and political freedom has much deeper roots than the Enlightenment of the 18th century.",,,1,0

Gellner posits three main stages of society: hunter/gatherer, agriculture and industry. He argues that the nature of cognition, production and coercion (power) is quite different in each stage. The development of an industrial society based on industry was a singular event, since agriculture, from which it arose, is inherently conservative and stable. Very particular circumstances had to occur simultaneously for a rational, enlightened, liberal society to emerge.<br/><br/>Some observations and analyses are convincing, others not quite. A major issue is the pervasive lack of concrete examples. For instance, Gellner discusses at length the ""many-strandedness"" of cognition in hunter/gatherer and agricultural society, and contrasts it with the ""single-strandedness"" characteristic of rational thought. But he gives few, if any, concrete examples of what this many-strandedness consist of.<br/><br/>As to the writing, it is clear and reasonably straightforward, but with an annoying habit of being indirect.

He argues against what he calls Veneer Theory, the view that morality in humans is just a thin layer on top of an amoral core. Instead, morality, or at least its fundamental building blocks, can be found in social mammals, and in particular in primates such as the chimpanzee. He posits that morality evolved, and evolution does not do discontinuities (saltatory changes). So the development must have been gradual. His views are discussed by the philosophers Robert Wright, Christine M Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer.<br/><br/>I believe de Waals has a number of valid points, and describes his own and other's findings very well. However, he is rightly criticized by Kitcher and Singer that he is vague when he claims that the ""building blocks"" of morality are there in chimpanzees, and therefore, by evolutionary extension, also in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. That concept seems to hide more than it reveals.<br/><br/>The basic issue here, I think, is the emergent nature of morality. Emergence is a tricky concept: it says that something new can spring out of something that already exists, given certain context and conditions. But it may also say that this new thing has some kind of beginning, a proto-existence, in the preceding state. And this new thing, when it has come into existence, can be viewed as something ""higher up"". It is based on what is below, but can also affect what is below. The terms often used, such as ""based on"", being ""the core of"" ""the foundation of"" and similar have a hard time conveying this sense that the emergent property can be both a function of, but also affect, the basis of its existence.<br/><br/>Morality is such an emergent property. It is based on psychological propensities common to humans and higher animals such as chimpanzees, but its reliance in humans on culture makes it different from what exists in chimpanzees. So although de Waal has a point that Veneer Theory is a bad way of describing morality, he too lightly skips over the large differences that culture and language produce when combined with the psychological common traits of humans and chimpanzees. In general, de Waal underplays the importance of culture in humans. Both Peter Singer and Philip Kitcher have valid critical points here.",,,1,0

Humans are cooperative, not only for mutual gain, but also altruistically. We care for one another. This entails not only the welfare of each other, but also in the upholding of norms that are part of the particular culture we live in. How did the peculiar behavior evolve?<br/><br/>The most common explanations invoke kin and reciprocity. Kin relationships can and do underlie altruistic behavior among many species. Reciprocity is rare among animals, but could in principle be invoked for some types of altruism. But Bowles and Gintis conclude that these do not sufficiently explain human cooperative behavior. Social preferences such as cooperation with unrelated people even when reciprocity is unlikely, and the propensity to punish free-riders and cheats even when doing so is costly, require other explanations.<br/><br/>The discussion is exhaustive, and in parts exhausting. The authors recapitulate very technical treatments of models and simulations, primarily relating to evolutionary theory and game theory approaches to cooperation. However, the reason is that they wish to show that the effects of kin and reciprocity cannot quantitatively account for the full extent of human cooperation. It is one thing to argue the qualitative effects, but another to show that the numbers add up. Bowles and Gintis goes through the formulae and numbers in detail, which is necessary, but heavy going for an amateur.<br/><br/>The authors argue that more is required to explain the evolution of human cooperation. Their answer is the co-evolution of institutions and group-mindedness, where culture and group competition act as critical factors. The driving force was the between-group competition that operated during Homo sapiens early evolution. This included the survival (or not) of groups of people in the harsh environment by inventing and maintaining the appropriate tools (in a wide sense) to deal with the challenges. It also included the inter-group competition and conflicts that could determine which one survived and which not.<br/><br/>Bowles and Gintis write that the ""individual motives and group-level institutions that account for cooperation among humans include not only the most elevated, including a concern for others, fair-mindedness, and democratic accountability of leaders, but also the most wicked, such as vengeance, racism. religious bigotry and hostility towards outsiders."" The ability to be good as well as evil has been our blessing and curse since our species evolved. It is our heritage.",,,1,0

In contrast to the general idea that there must be some single factor that is fundamentally responsible for the difference between the species Homo sapiens and its closest relatives, Henrich builds a case that many different factors are important, and that their interplay was essential in driving human evolution. Once the first tentative steps into man's cultural addiction were taken, the playing field tilted, as it were, to favor even more culture, including social and political norms, eventually giving rise to the modern human society.

It combines hard-headed reasoning with attention to detail, willingness to propose bold hypotheses, careful analysis of arguments, and honesty about points where the evidence is weak.<br/><br/>The primatologist Richard Wrangham posits that our ancestors became Homo sapiens by a process of simultaneous reduction of reactive aggression (response to attack and threat) and increase of proactive aggression (premeditated attack against others). The reduction of reactive aggression occurred in a process of self-domestication, while proactive aggression got its boost from a combination of language, the coalition of males against tyrannical alpha males, and inter-group conflict.<br/><br/>Wrangham explores the evolutionary basis for these changes compared to our latest common ancestors with great apes and also, as far as the evidence allows us to say anything, Neanderthals. His controversial explanation is what he calls the execution hypothesis. At some point maybe 300,000 years ago, our ancestors acquired the ability to form coalitions. The males in a group started collaborating to control and, in the ultimate case, execute any tyrannical alpha male. Over the generations, this reduced the propensity for reactive aggression. The new-found power of the male collective also led to the development of morals, shame, and guilt, as regulators of behavior as mechanisms for avoiding the potentially lethal disapproval of the group.<br/><br/>Wrangham is that kind of scientist and thinker who does not shirk from the idea that terrible mechanisms can yield good results. He displays palpable disdain for the Rousseauian idea that humans are naturally good, while civilisation has made us twisted and evil. But neither is he a fully committed Hobbesian; he thinks morality, altruism and cooperation are part of our nature, and not something an authority has to force us into.<br/><br/>In the final chapter of the book Wrangham writes: ""... evolution has left us with biases that affect our behavior in predictable and sometimes disturbing ways, and we would do well to acknowledge those biases."" It is my belief that modern political philosophers need to question their various assumptions about human nature, morality and society in the light of the evolutionary insights that Wrangham and many others have provided during the last 30 or so years.",,,1,0

He describes the development of the human child and its abilities from birth to 6 years of age, and contrasts it to the abilities of mainly chimpanzees. It is during this time that most, if not all, capabilities that makes humans human manifest themselves. It's a story of how the hypersocial nature of humans is made possible by evolutionary changes in various capabilities that in some form or another existed already in the last common ancestor of humans and great apes. These changes eventually produced a species for which accumulative culture, language, cooperation and reason are rooted in biology, but at the same time go far beyond biology. Tomasello calls this the ""shared intentionality theory"", since it relies heavily on the notion of shared intentionality, in which two or more individuals share a common goal and understanding in a situation, and they understand that the other understands this also. This develops into collective intentionality, which is essentially human culture. The text is dense, so this is not an easy read. But it is rewarding, inspiring and provocative.",,,1,0

Wilson arrives at the answer only after careful analysis, e.g. by making a distinction between altruism in action and altruism in thought. The book is based on the notion of group selection in evolution, a concept recently rehabilitated by, among others, the author himself. Group selection, or more generally, multi-level selection, can occur  under fairly well-defined circumstances, overriding or modifying ""ordinary"" individual selection. Rather than disproving the selfish gene theory, Wilson clarifies why and how that theory is not and cannot be the whole answer.<br/><br/>Wilson also ventures into the arena of politics and philosophy, which is a dangerous thing for biologists, and evolutionists in particular, to do. But he pulls it off admirably. The discussion centers around Elinor Ostrom's theory of how the tragedy of the commons can be avoided (a prime example of altruism in action), and the connection of this concept to evolutionary mechanisms is explored. An interesting and provocative observation is that altruism is actually a modern concept, and does not figure in the major religions, at least not under the definition used by Wilson.",,,1,0

It manages to explain a very complicated process of develpment of the embroy by focusing on the fundamental mechanisms. In particular it makes clear the fact that all forces working during development are in a certain sense local, that is, there is no overarching direction or plan. Every cell is doing what is natural for it at that specific place given its internal and external context.<br/><br/>A most important point that the book brings across is that the phrase ""gene X is responsible for feature Y"" is extremely misleading. It is a short-hand for the scientific statement that when one alters gene X, for example makes it non-functional, then feature Y of the embryo or the mature organism is in some way changed or dysfunctional. This does not mean that gene X contains all information required to produce Y. The genomes is *not* a blueprint of the organism, it is more like a recipe for how to produce the organism given a suitable environment, a recipe where many genes are involved in creating each feature of the organism.",,,1,0

It carefully describes from where differences between humans arise, and how genetic and environmental variation can play out in different ways. The main message is that genes provide a set of potentials, or propensities, for how the organism can develop depending on the environment. Sometimes the genes limit the possible panorama of outcomes very tightly, sometimes only slightly, and sometimes a small set of possible outcomes are available. Importantly, in the latter case, the effects of pure chance can become crucial: if a system is set up to allow a divergence in development - a fork in the road, as it were - then the final result cannot be said to be neither ""in"" the genes nor determined by the environment. And yet it is innate.<br/><br/>I have a minor quibble: In a few paragraphs, the language has a few too many bio-jargon terms, which ought to have been edited away.<br/><br/>In the last pages, Mitchell makes a brief visit in the philosophical mine-field of determinism. He states that his view does not undermine free will, but he rejects dualism (the view that brain and mind are different). But he also writes ""The mind is not a thing at all - at least, it is not an object. It is a process, or a set of processes - it is, simply put, the brain at work.""<br/><br/>This seems to me to beg the issue. When he continues to affirm that the logical content of a thought - its meaning - can have a casual power in and of itself, by being an emergent phenomenon, then he seems to me to be much more of a dualist than he wants to admit. Now, I have absolutely no problem with this at all. The notion that the content of thoughts can have a causal power seems to me to contradict material determinism. The dualism (or rather theory of Worlds 1, 2 and 3) that Karl Popper espoused in ""The Self and Its Brain"" (with John Eccles) is, in my mind (!), a highly fascinating attempt at solving the mind-body problem.",,,1,0

It is not a matter of applying pre-existing moral axioms - either god-given or rationally derived à la Kant - but rather a creative exercise in inventing new solutions to new problems. He calls this approach ethical naturalism. Johnson relies heavily in John Dewey and argues against Immanuel Kant, whose ethics he considers to be actually very similar to the religious fundamentalist's idea of morals as given by a commanding god, but minus the god. He says that in the same way that Kant tried to de-theologize Judeo-Christian ethics, so Rawls tries to de-transcendentalize Kant, removing Kant's claims of absolute foundations in pure practical reason, while keeping most of the rest of Kant's moral vision. He defends Dewey's idea of the ""qualitative unity of the situation"", but I fail to see what that position actually does. It seems to me that this particular line of argument makes the theory more prone to relativism than it needs to be.<br/><br/>Basically, Johnson considers the quest for ethical certainty in a small set of moral axioms to be fundamentally mistaken. Moral problem-solving is an empirical inquiry. He maintains that this does not lead inevitably to relativism. Criticism of moral ideals is possible, and we are not prisoners of our inherited moral frameworks. Progress is possible. In my mind, his approach fits very well with the evolutionary wave of thinking that is currently under way in the science and philosophy of human nature. Although he does not refer to Karl Popper or Michael Tomasello, I think there are clear points of contact in the approach.<br/><br/>I can recommend this text. It is well written, clear and forceful.

But, of course, having a despotic stat does not really solve the problem. Liberty cannot flourish in either a state of anarchy (Absent Leviathan) or a tyranny (Despotic Leviathan). What is required is a state whose powers are controlled by a strong civil society with democratic traditions, a Shackled Leviathan.<br/><br/>The Narrow Corridor of the title refers to the thin area in a diagram where the x- and y-axis denote the power of the state, and society, respectively. The part of the diagram where the state has overwhelming power is the Despotic Leviathan, where the state is weak is the Absent Leviathan, which often means a clan-based society.<br/><br/>I find the analysis convincing, in general. It is not so much a theory of society as a way to analyse what happened in particular cases. The requirements for a society to get into, and stay inside, the Narrow Corridor are always dependent on the particular historical circumstances. The authors tell stories about what happened in a number of cases, and although I cannot claim to be an expert, I cannot spot any direct and obvious misreadings of history.<br/><br/>The main take-home message I got from this book is the contingent nature of a state of liberty. Often, the liberal view seems to be that democracy and a free society are somehow natural, and other types of states and society are perversions. In contrast the view in this book is rather that a free, individualistic society is very much a special case, which requires hard work to reach and maintain. I believe this is correct.",,,1,0

Today, the postcolonial movement proposes ""respect"" for other cultures.

Its thesis is that free will is an illusion and that the criminal justice system therefore is fundamentally flawed. I believe this is untenable. Interestingly, Sapolsky seems to acknowledge that his view has weird consequences: ""If we deny free will when it comes to he worst of our behaviors, the same must also apply to the best. [...] I can't really imagine how to live your life as if there is no free will."" This undercuts his own accusation against free will, namely that it is absurd; his alternative is also, apparently, absurd.<br/><br/>Sapolsky argues from the standpoint of deterministic materialism. In that world view, there is no room for logic, knowledge or moral values. And no, one does not have to be religious to acknowledge that those things also exist in the universe, along with physical entities. Sapolsky does not seem to realize that a universe that is purely materialistic implies that the book he has written contains no knowledge, arguments, or moral reasoning, just some markings in black paint printed on paper which reflects light that just happens to activate certain neurons in the reader's brain.

The starting point is the propensity in chimpanzees for the collective in a flock to react and take action against an overbearing and severely abusive alpha male. The author argues that this propensity must have been present in the common ancestor to humans and chimpanzee. Add to this the egalitarian trends that followed (or preceded?) ancient humans developing a hunting strategy for larger prey. Such prey could be brought down only through collaboration, and the meat had to be divided in reasonably equal shares, or the group would not be able to maintain this strategy. An important step was the development of a conscience and of shame, which the author hypothesizes was the evolutionary result of the group's aversion to alpha-male bullying and free-riding. Being thrown out of the group, or killed outright, because the rest of the group got fed up with them, was a risk that put a severe selection pressure on strong and successful individuals to rein in their egoistical impulses. By anticipating and internalizing the judgement of the group, such individuals could pass on their genes. Altruism, primarily with the immediate next-of-kin but also with the rest of the group, would bestow a reputational benefit on individuals, thus enhancing their chance of passing on their genes. This argument depends on reputation being communicated, so language is required. This text does not discuss how language evolved, so there is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here. Did language evolve for this kind of communication (gossip), or, as Mercier and Sperber suggest, as a means of justifying an individuals actions?

She discusses both the evolutionary and mechanistic processes underlying our humanity. A nice read, with several important and sometimes provocative points delivered in a well-written text. Churchland begins with defining conscience as ""knowledge of the community standards"", and goes on to describe how such standards have been internalized in the human mind.<br/><br/>Science cannot tell us what is morally right, but it can probe why we are moral, and how that faculty is grounded in the biological reality of humans as social beings. The fact that humans are born helpless and require assistance by parents and others for many years is both a cause and effect of our hypersocial nature. Our cognitive flexibility presupposes a long learning period. We are clearly wired for cooperation in an extreme degree, and this requires norms and values. Fairness in sharing the results of collaboration is a basic human attitude.<br/><br/>Churchland criticizes the strong western tradition in moral philosophy of searching for strict universal rules as a basis for morality. As examples of such philosophy, she first dispatches of the religious attempt to build morality on the god(s); the Socratic dialogue Euthyphro invalidated that project. Next, she looks at the twin secular attempts at universal moral rules: Immanuel Kant, on the one hand, and the utilitarians, on the other, both attempting, in very different ways, to formulate a fundamental moral rule. One of her points (which reminds me of Isaiah Berlin's discussion about the plurality of values) is that moral choices must be viewed as acts of constraint satisfaction, where different values and considerations come into play depending on the circumstances, and that there is little reason to believe that a single principle could ever handle all possible situations. Social life is simply too complex.

That is, why the lag time? His interesting suggestion is that it has to do with population size. Cultural transmission benefits hugely from a larger population size. Conversely, a too small population makes it very hard to maintain a certain cultural level. The standard example here is the Tasmanian indigenous culture, which after having been cut off from Australia, clearly regressed.<br/><br/>However, this suggestion somewhat begs the question. Why did the population increase? Could cultural advances have caused this, or was it just (?) due to external causes, such as climate change?<br/><br/>Minor quibble: Rutherford discusses rape as a phenomenon, and argues that although very similar behavior (i.e. violently enforced sex) can be seen in some other species, such as dolphins, those instances should not be called ""rape"" since that is a legal term.

He also weaves in other results from anthropology and the social sciences to show that human behavior has roots and counterparts among mammals and apes more often that is usually realized.<br/><br/>De Waal spends a lot of text attacking the so-called new atheists (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, et al) while at the same time actually agreeing to a lot of what they in fact say. He criticizes Harris for wanting to base morality on science, and distances himself from this view most strenuously, but at the same time bases his own view on morality to a large degree on what the science says. It seems his main bone of contention with the new atheists is that they are vocal and explicit in their critique of religion. His defense of religion is rather tepid; the absence of belief in a moralistic God would create a ""vacuum"", he contends. As with many intellectuals who use this argument, he himself is an atheist, so apparently that vacuum can't be too bad. He at the same time repeatedly states that morality preceded religion, and that the idea of a moralistic God is most likely a fairly recent phenomenon, at least in the evolutionary timescale. This undermines the idea that religion is vital to our life.",,,1,0

En hel del resonemang är bra och tydliga. Men i stort sett alla exempel på trams som tas upp stryker den standardmässiga, ""politiskt korrekta"" (notera mina ironiska citattecken) åsiktsriktningen medhårs. Det kunde ha funnits en poäng att ta med ett längre resonemang om trams som många råkar hålla med om, exempelvis att GMO är farligt. Hennes resonemang om vad vetenskap är utgår från ett ganska snävt naturvetenskapligt kvantitativt synsätt. Statistik är viktigt, men vetenskap kan också bestå i klara, logiska resonemang som är i grunden kvalitativa. Det finns heller inte mycket om vetenskapliga fiaskon. Författaren är forskare vid KI och det borde ha varit naturligt att diskutera Macchiarini-skandalen. Trams finns även inom vetenskapen ibland.",,,1,0

Framförallt får man intrycket att Per Molander tror att bara Socialdemokraterna fortsatt vara helt traditionella socialdemokrater så hade allt varit så mycket bättre.

Ett framträdande tema i boken är spänningen mellan de universella liberala argumenten (rättigheter, nytta, etc) och de mer historiskt baserade resonemangen. Detta är en dimension som nästan helt saknas i dagens politiska debatt. Nycander gör mig intresserad av de tänkare som hade ett mer historiskt synsätt, som exempelvis Francois Guizot.

Jag kritiserar detta i en artikel som jag hoppas få publicerad på annan plats.<br/><br/>Jag sympatiserar visserligen med hennes kritik av postmodernismen, men den diskussion är alldeles för trubbig. Hennes enträgna påståenden om essens-tänkandets förträfflighet och den därmed kopplade idoliseringen av Platon är ytterst märklig.<br/><br/>Hennes beskrivning av Karl Poppers idéer är ganska omfattande, men den är häpnadsväckande missvisande, och i delar direkt felaktig.

Individen frodas i ett socialt och politiskt sammanhang där debatt och förnuft är centrala. Denna ingång, som polemiserar mot nidbilden att individualism är i grunden asocial, kombineras med tre värdebegrepp för individualismen: autenticitet, individualitet och singularitet.<br/><br/>Boken är i huvudsak klar och redig, och argumenterar ärligt. Men det finns vissa problem som härrör från dess bitvis onödigt filosofisk-tekniska terminologi. Ahlin Marceta vill hävda ett ""svagt politiskt ideal"". Den termen orsakar nog mer förvirring än klarhet även om den är oklanderlig ur akademisk filosofisk synvinkel.<br/><br/>Det finns mycket att gilla med denna boken. Det finns många intressanta idéer, teman och resonemang. Den gör klart att fri marknadsekonomi inte är grundbulten i liberalt tänkande, och den visar på stråk i den liberala idéhistorien som behöver komma i fokus igen.<br/><br/>Men den är inte helt sammanhängande, och dess koppling till politisk praktik är, trots goda ansatser, inte så tydlig. Den sitter litet på gärsgården mellan politisk ideologi och politisk filosofi. Dess analys av svensk socialdemokrati är litet tveksam, och frånvaron av diskussion om socialliberalism är litet överraskande.<br/><br/>Bokens resonemang om kultur, arbete och medborgarskap är mycket intressanta, och bär inom sig frön till framtida diskussioner. Detta är inte en färdig liberalism, utan ett inlägg som syftar till framtida debatt.",,,1,0

As these ideas and values have successively been influencing society, their unintended but necessary effects are the problems we face today: populism, alienation, commercialism, depletion of the environment, income inequality, etc. He makes the point that there is no easy way of fixing liberalism, since the causes of the problems are in the roots of liberalism itself. If there is one stylistic problem with the book, it is that he makes this point far too many times.<br/><br/>Although I think there is some merit to the argument that the current problems of liberalism are due to its fundamentals, Deneen does not seem to realize that his argument proves too much. He states that at least some liberal ideas stem from Christian thinking, but if that is the case, did not those original ideas also contain in themselves the same self-destructive potential that he attributes to liberalism? Is it perhaps so that those Christian thoughts also contained in themselves the seeds of secularism and of liberal developments? This is at any rate the thesis proposed by Larry Siedentop in his ""Inventing the Individual"", which I have reviewed briefly in this site. If Deneen had read Siedentop, he would have had a more difficult time portraying the emergence of liberalism as a fall from the communitarian Eden of previous times. Incidentally, it is hard to figure out when that Eden was supposed to have existed. Sometimes, Deneen seems to locate this Eden in the New England as described by Tocqueville, but at other times one gets the impression that he is talking about pre-renaissance times.<br/><br/>Towards the end of his book, Deneen does grudgingly accept that liberalism does represent some kind of advance. Although he is unable to say this without reiterating his withering contempt for liberalism, he is explicit that there can be no turning back. He has a very hard time proposing an alternative. He describes rather vaguely a so-called Benedictine option, a kind of low-key communitarian practical living that attempts to carve out a space outside of modern society. A community basing its life on organic tradition is to be achieved by explicit design. Deneen is conscious of the inherent contradiction of this proposal. So, the book is a failure, but an interesting one.",,,1,0

Instead, Larry Siedentop maintains that the crucial ingredients are found in St Pauls invention of Christianity, in particular the idea that all humans are equal before God, combined with a modified rationalism from Greece and Rome. The struggle between and within church and state in the context of the dissolution of the Roman empire, and the interaction between ideas and society during the Middle Ages laid the essential groundwork for the idea of secularity, among other things. The main intellectual inventions required for liberalism were already in place before the Renaissance. Please note that the author does not maintain that liberalism requires faith in Christianity, only that it grew out of it. The writing is clear and straightforward. The only criticism I have is that the author hammers home his thesis a little too often. ",,,1,0

She attempts to write not only about the kings, consuls and emperors, but also about what is known about the lives and circumstances of citizens and slaves. It is a good read, and I recommend it. I learned a lot and gained a better perspective of events that I knew of since before. She writes in a more-or-less chronological fashion about the events up to Augustus, and after that in a more thematic way, and she gives good reasons for this approach.<br/><br/>One minor complaint I have is that Beard, in a few cases, mentions certain events as if assuming that the reader already knows about them. To be sure, she often comes back to those events later in the text, and explains them more fully. But still, it makes for some mystification.<br/><br/>The other complaint concerns the discussion of the methodological problems about what we can now, given the fragmentary and biased evidence we have. I'm not entirely sure why, but the discussion left me a little unsatisfied. Maybe because it was too theoretical or vague, or that it bordered on the trivial? Anyway, this is a minor issue.

But of course one cannot cram all of humanity's history into 500 or so pages without problems. Oversimplification is bound to happen. His approach to condense the story into first a pre-history part and then a number of parts of thematic accounts works fairly well. I do not mind the author being opinionated, he is pretty straightforward about it.<br/><br/>His points about the scientific revolution being predicated on the realization that we are ignorant, and that empires are more than just evil ideas of the corrupt West (as many would have it), are provocative and interesting, in my mind.<br/><br/>My main complaints concern:<br/><br/>1) His view of culture being layered on top of biology, which seems to ignore the essential interrelatedness of culture and biology in the evolution of Homo.<br/><br/>2) His description of the development and relationships of cognitive, cooperative, moral and other features during Homo evolution are, I think, not quite coherent. The author makes clear that the raw data here is woefully inadequate, for obvious reasons, but I think there are some points here that do could be given a different interpretation.<br/><br/>3) his insistence on using the term ""imagination"" about social constructs such as status, knowledge and stories, which I think misses the point that such social constructs have a logic of their own, which makes them more ""real"" than just ""imaginative"". I think the term ""invented"" would have been better; once invented, the social constructs take on a life of their own.<br/><br/>4) His insistence that modern political ideologies are just religions in another form is unhelpful. It obscures the real differences for provocative ends. It does have a few points, but in general this is not a sharp analysis.<br/><br/>5) His characterization of Nazism as being a variant of evolutionary political thinking is so one-sided that it is practically false. It ignores completely the long prehistory of antisemitism in Christianity, the German nationalistic strands of thought that came out of the Romantic reaction the Enlightenment, and other aspects as well.",,,1,0

Her treatment also makes the point that liberal thought is not just a British and American affair, but that Germany, and in particular, France, was historically main arenas for liberal struggle against the monarchy, strong-man rule and the reactionary Catholic church.

In order to argue for something, it is often a highly successful rhetorical strategy to portray it as natural. Why is that? One insight in Levinovitz' book is that ""natural"" is a religious term: ""'Nature' is another term for God; 'natural', a synonym for holy.""<br/><br/>Levinovitz takes a close look at several debates where the idea of what is ""natural"" is at the center. Some topics he investigates are: How to give birth (fun fact: the patron saint of childbirth is Raymond Nonnatus, literally ""not-born"", because cut from his dying mother's womb); the complications of vanilla; the conflicting views of the origin of mankind as the prototypical noble Savage or the nasty, brutish and short lives of the first humans; the contortions of the Catholic church in applying some version of ""naturalness"" for deciding which birth control techniques are permissible; and many others.<br/><br/>He is elegantly scathing when describing the ""consecrated consumption"" underpinning celebrity woo such as Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop line of products, and Deepak Chopra's involvement in high-priced condo schemes (""completely reinvent how we should all be living""). ""Nature"" priced at luxury rates exclusively for the elite.<br/><br/>He highlights the common conflation of ""natural"" with ""good"", but also acknowledges and is respectful of the deep need that humans have for finding good ways to live, and for confronting the challenges and questions of existence.<br/><br/>The one issue I have with the book is that it uses the phrase ""the unnatural animal"" about humans, without investigating it further. Thus it misses out on what I believe is an important point. The ability, or rather the necessity, of humans to construct cultures as a way of living underlies many conflicts where the concept of ""naturalness"" is used as argument. The cultural patterns that one wishes to promote gain in credibility if they are seen as ""natural"", rather than developed by humans. And culture is unnatural in the sense that it would not exist if humans did not exist (barring a few proto-cultural examples among certain mammals), but it is also natural since Homo sapiens would not exist without it.<br/><br/>Levinovits ends with a conclusion that may be viewed as unsatisfying: compromise. Nature is wonderful, inspiring, and it can teach us a lot. But human actions and inventions to overcome nature are required for a better life. ""Philosophical confusion isn't a sin, it's a virtue.""",,,1,0

The message is that liberals and conservatives (in the American sense) have different ""moral matrices"", i.e. value different aspects of human life and society differently. In one sentence: liberals are more concerned with care for individuals, while conservatives value the social fabric higher. Obviously, the argument in the book is more complex than this.<br/><br/>I have some reservations about the arguments concerning religion. The book's main argument is clearly focused on the situation in the US, but it does have considerable relevance to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I am myself a liberal, according to the book's classification. But I have lately seen more clearly the points of ""the other side"", and we are in real need of a discussion. Haidt is hopeful that it may be possible.

This book makes the case that that philosophy has not and cannot be killed off by science, which position I wholeheartedly agree with. The book is an analysis and interpretation of Plato's and Socrates' philosophies. The main problem I have with the account is that it is strongly and explicitly apolitical. Although the author does describe the political background, she does not draw any conclusions from the strong connection between Plato's ethics and politics, which connection I think is obvious. I am influenced in my thinking by Karl Popper's treatment of this question in his ""The Open Society and Its Enemies"", which is not discussed at all in the current book. One of the important points Popper makes is that one should discuss a philosopher's ideas in light of the problems that he/she was facing, and that this makes it much easier to interpret the arguments used. In contrast, Goldstein argues that the issue of how the positions were arrived at is secondary to the issue of whether they are valid or not, a statement that I think misses the point.",,,1,0

Det är alltför mycket en pyttipanna av insikter, hypoteser, åsikter och förslag. Det är alltför ofta osammanhängande och ambivalent. Exempelvis är diskussionen om så kallade medborgarförslag och medborgarmotioner dåligt strukturerad, bitvis repetitiv, och ibland direkt inkoherent.<br/><br/>Ett grundläggande problem är att bokens syfte är att motverka populismen, dvs Sverigedemokraterna. Men demokratins, och utredningens, syfte borde väl ytterst vara att åstadkomma ett samhälle som medborgarna vill ha? Den frågan präglar inte boken, vilket den borde.<br/><br/>Den rädsla som bokens titel hänsyftar på är den rädsla som sägs vara en viktig bevekelsegrund för SD:s väljare. Den rädsla som genomsyrar texten är snarare just risken att SD får något att säga till om. Ibland glimmar det till, och författarna visar att de kan förstå att många är besvikna på den liberala demokratins empiriska förmåga att leverera, men denna insikt utvecklas inte tillfredsställande. Det bestående intrycket är att betydelsen av SD, Brexit och Trump ännu inte tagit skruv ordentligt. Det är inte den liberala demokratins formalia som är problemet, utan dess substans, dess resultat, men kanske framförallt dess brist på resultat.",,,1,0
